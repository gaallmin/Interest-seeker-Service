We know that the culture of higher education is different from the culture of the military in meaningful ways, and we also know that one of the keys to excelling in college–especially for student veterans–is learning to navigate these differences successfully, right from the very start.

This course aims to help you do just that. First, the course will orient you to the norms and expectations of the college classroom. The quicker you know what is expected of you, the quicker you can start learning. Second, the course will offer you strategies to ease your transition, to help you achieve your academic goals, and to allow you to make the most of your college education.

However, the challenge facing scientists is analyzing and even accessing these data to extract useful information pertaining to the system being studied. This course focuses on employing existing bioinformatic resources – mainly web-based programs and databases – to access the wealth of data to answer questions relevant to the average biologist, and is highly hands-on. 

Topics covered include multiple sequence alignments, phylogenetics, gene expression data analysis, and protein interaction networks, in two separate parts. 

The first part, Bioinformatic Methods I (this one), deals with databases, Blast, multiple sequence alignments, phylogenetics, selection analysis and metagenomics. 

The second part, Bioinformatic Methods II, covers motif searching, protein-protein interactions, structural bioinformatics, gene expression data analysis, and cis-element predictions. 

This pair of courses is useful to any student considering graduate school in the biological sciences, as well as students considering molecular medicine. Both provide an overview of the many different bioinformatic tools that are out there. 

These courses are based on one taught at the University of Toronto to upper-level undergraduates who have some understanding of basic molecular biology. If you're not familiar with this, something like https://learn.saylor.org/course/bio101 might be helpful. No programming is required for this course.

Humans are natural network scientists, as we compute new network configurations all the time, almost unaware, when thinking about friends and family (which are particular forms of social networks), about colleagues and organizational relations (other, overlapping network structures), and about how to navigate delicate or opportunistic network configurations to save guard or advance in our social standing (with society being one big social network itself). While such network structures always existed, computational social science has helped to reveal and to study them more systematically. In the first part of the course we focus on network structure. This looks as static snapshots of networks, which can be intricate and reveal important aspects of social systems.

A modern VLSI chip is a remarkably complex beast:  billions of transistors, millions of logic gates deployed for computation and control, big blocks of memory, embedded blocks of pre-designed functions designed by third parties (called “intellectual property” or IP blocks).  How do people manage to design these complicated chips?  Answer:  a sequence of computer aided design (CAD) tools takes an abstract description of the chip, and refines it step-wise to a final design. This class focuses on the major design tools used in the creation of an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) or System on Chip (SoC) design.  Our focus in this part of the course is on the key logical and geometric representations that make it possible to map from logic to layout, and in particular, to place, route, and evaluate the timing of large logic networks. Our goal is for students to understand how the tools themselves work, at the level of their fundamental algorithms and data structures. Topics covered will include: technology mapping, timing analysis, and ASIC placement and routing.

Recommended Background:
Programming experience (C, C++, Java, Python, etc.) and basic knowledge of data structures and algorithms (especially recursive algorithms).  An understanding of basic digital design:  Boolean algebra, Kmaps, gates and flip flops, finite state machine design.  Linear algebra and calculus at the level of a junior or senior in engineering.

　　房屋為我們遮風避雨，讓我們安心工作、生活，而結構系統又是房屋的骨幹，讓房屋能站的又高、又直、又穩。你知道橫者為梁，直者為柱，但你知道在結構工程師的眼中，梁與柱有什麼其他的不同嗎？他們其中藏著什麼秘密，能支撐起整個結構？工程師要怎麼決定梁該有多深？柱該有多粗？該用矩形、圓形還是其他形狀？該用實心還是空心？在有地震的地方，設計上是否又有不一樣的考量？
　　材料力學是通往上述問題解答關鍵的一步。在材料力學(一)裡，我們會由大家熟知的虎克定律開始，以蓋房子的重要材料「結構鋼」為例，深入探討「力量」與「變形」這兩個令結構工程師愛恨交加的物理量之間的關係。然後依序探討結構桿件受軸力（拉/壓）、受扭、受彎、受剪四大外力作用下，會在桿件內部產生怎樣的相對應變形與受力，並探討建築結構設計概念與提供桿件設計演算範例。
　　本課程是希望精通「鋼筋混凝土設計」、「鋼結構設計」、「木構造設計」者必備的先修課程，也為對「彈性力學」有興趣者，提供許多基礎知識與這些知識如何實際應用於工程設計。
主要授課對象為土木、建築相關從業人員與在學學生，其他包括工學院各科系同學或對材料力學有興趣的人士，也歡迎選修。

Las personas que viven en situación de discapacidad presentan mayores niveles de deprivación en diferentes ámbitos: inserción al mercado del trabajo, nivel educacional, etc. 

Esto nos obliga como sociedad a repensar nuestro trabajo en esta materia desde un enfoque que garantice igual trato para todos. Pues, una sociedad que espere promover igualdad de oportunidades y espacios de desarrollo para todos sus miembros, debe poner especial atención con aquellos sectores que han sido postergados durante generaciones, esto ocurre con especial fuerza en nuestros países del tercer mundo. No obstante comprender el actual enfoque de Derechos permite orientar la acción hacía planes y programas que permitan garantizar accesibilidad e inclusión social para personas en situación de discapacidad.


Nosotros buscamos promover que la labor social, laboral o profesional se enmarque en los principios y fundamentos del enfoque de Derechos en discapacidad, por lo que los estudiantes que desarrollen este curso desarrollen una mirada crítica de las prácticas de apoyo de las personas en situación de discapacidad. Posterior a 10 años del nacimiento de la Convención sobre los derechos de las personas con discapacidad, se hace urgente su difusión, comprensión y crítica por parte de los ciudadanos a objeto de modificar prácticas que hoy resultan contradictorias, ilegítimas e innecesarias, las que suelen atentar, en contra de la autonomía y derechos de las personas con discapacidad.

El propósito del curso es promover que la labor social, laboral o profesional se enmarque en los principios y fundamentos del enfoque de Derechos en discapacidad. De esta manera los los estudiantes podrán reflexionar sobre el enfoque de Derechos consagrado en la Convención de Naciones Unidas sobre Derechos de las Personas con Discapacidad, las diferencias conceptuales entre modelos, enfoques y teorías en el ámbito de la discapacidad en su proceso de tránsito conceptual. De esta manera, los estudiantes analizarán distintos ámbitos de aplicación de dichos modelos y conceptualizaciones en ámbitos de salud, educación y trabajo, comprendiendo una visión integral del desarrollo humano de una sociedad desde el enfoque de derechos humanos."

136,yS8ezjDPEeW-zwq84wShFQ,Reason and Persuasion: Thinking Through Three Dialogues By Plato,plato-dialogues,"In this course we study the ancient, Socratic art of blowing up your beliefs as you go, to make sure they're built to last. We spend six weeks studying three Platonic dialogues - ""Euthyphro"", ""Meno"", ""Republic"" Book I - then two weeks pondering a pair of footnotes to Plato: contemporary moral theory and moral psychology. 

Platonic? Socratic? Socrates was the teacher, but he said he never did. Plato was the student who put words in his teacher's mouth. You'll get a feel for it.

We have a book: the new 4th edition of ""Reason and Persuasion"", by the instructor (and his wife, Belle Waring, the translator.) It contains the Plato you need, plus introductory material and in-depth, chapter-length commentaries. (Don't worry! John Holbo knows better than to read his book to the camera. The videos cover the same material, but the presentation is different.) 

The book is offered free in PDF form - the whole thing, and individual chapter slices. It is also available in print and other e-editions. See the course content for links and information.

The course is suitable for beginning students of Plato and philosophy, but is intended to offer something to more advanced students as well. We seek new, odd angles on old, basic angles. Tricky! The strategy is to make a wide-ranging, interdisciplinary approach.  Lots of contemporary connections, to make the weird bits intuitive; plus plenty of ancient color, still bright after all these years. So: arguments and ideas, new possibilities, old stories, fun facts. Plus cartoons. 

The results can get elaborate (some book chapters and some lesson videos run long.) But each video comes with a brief summary of its contents. The lessons progress. I put them in this order for reasons. But there's no reason you can't skip over and around to find whatever seems most interesting. There are any number of self-contained mini-courses contained in this 8-week course. You are welcome to them.

Plato has meant different things to different people. He's got his own ideas, no doubt. (Also, his own Ideas.) But these have, over the centuries, been worn into crossing paths for other feet; been built up into new platforms for projecting other voices. (Plato did it to Socrates, so fair is fair.) So your learning outcome should be: arrival somewhere interesting, in your head, where you haven't been before. I wouldn't presume to dictate more exactly."
137,Axwi2MCtEeedJRJjt8USWA,Influencer Marketing Strategy,influencer-marketing-strategy,"Influencer marketing is the practice of engaging internal and industry experts with active networks to help achieve measurable business goals. 

This course is about strategy. Although there is no all-purpose, one-size-fits-all influencer marketing strategy template, you will learn how to tailor one for a wide variety of B2B, B2C, and nonprofit organizations using the two-step flow model of communication.
 
But this course is also about tactics. I believe, “Strategy without tactics is the slowest route to victory. Tactics without strategy is the noise before defeat.” So, you will learn both in this 6-week long course.

Your final project for this course is to create a pitch deck for a social media influencer strategy. The purpose of your final project is to give you a concrete artifact that you can use to demonstrate your mastery of new competencies and skills to either the executives in your current organization or to prospective employers."

171,SxXuFKkyEeyjPxJkzIUqCw,Build an End-to-End Data Capture Pipeline using Document AI,googlecloud-build-an-end-to-end-data-capture-pipeline-using-document-ai-wiisg,"This is a self-paced lab that takes place in the Google Cloud console. In this lab you use Cloud Functions and Pub/Sub to create an end-to-end document processing pipeline using Document AI. The Document AI API is a document understanding solution that takes unstructured data, such as documents and emails, and makes the data easier to understand, analyze, and consume.

In this lab, you will create a document processing pipeline that will automatically process documents that are uploaded to Cloud Storage. The pipeline consists of a primary Cloud Function that processes new files that are uploaded to Cloud Storage using a Document AI form processor and then saves form data detected in those files to BigQuery. If the form data includes any address fields the address data is then written to a Pub/Sub topic that in turn triggers a second Cloud Function that uses to Geocoding API to provide geographic coordinate data for the address that is also written to BigQuery.

This is a simple pipeline that uses a general form processor that will detect basic form data, such as a labelled field containing address information. Document AI processors that use one of the specialized parsers that are beyond the scope of this lab provide enhanced entity information for specific document types even when those documents do not include labelled fields. For example, a Document AI Invoice parser can provide detailed address and supplier information, from an unlabelled invoice document because it understands the layout of invoices."

Una población de posibles soluciones de un problema dado es análoga a una población de organismos vivos que evolucionan cada generación, al recombinar los mejores individuos de la población y transmitir sus características de dichos individuos padres, a sus descendientes. En este campo, diferentes esquemas de métodos evolutivos se han desarrollado, los cuales difieren en el tipo de estructuras que conforman la población.
Algoritmos evolutivos (AE), como también se le conoce al cómputo evolutivo (EC), se definen como métodos de optimización y búsqueda, los cuales están inspirados y tratan de imitar de manera parcial los procesos de la evolución natural, y mantienen una población de estructuras que evolucionan de acuerdo a reglas de selección y otros operadores genéticos, como cruzamiento y mutación (Bäck, 1996).
Los algoritmos evolutivos no son los únicos métodos de optimización propuestos a partir de sistemas biológicos. Se tiene una variedad de algoritmos de optimización, que tratan de imitar el comportamiento de sistemas naturales, como las colonias de hormigas, algoritmos culturales y optimización por cúmulos de partículas, entre otros. De aquí surge lo que se conoce como algoritmos bioinspirados, ya que toman sus bases a partir de la estructura de procesos y sistemas biológicos: la evolución, la selección natural, comportamiento social de animales, como las hormigas, abejas, peces.

In asymmetric cryptography or public-key cryptography, the sender and the receiver use a pair of public-private keys, as opposed to the same symmetric key, and therefore their cryptographic operations are asymmetric. This course will first review the principles of asymmetric cryptography and describe how the use of the pair of keys can provide different security properties. Then, we will study the popular asymmetric schemes in the RSA cipher algorithm and the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange protocol and learn how and why they work to secure communications/access. Lastly, we will discuss the key distribution and management for both symmetric keys and public keys and describe the important concepts in public-key distribution such as public-key authority, digital certificate, and public-key infrastructure. This course also describes some mathematical concepts, e.g., prime factorization and discrete logarithm, which become the bases for the security of asymmetric primitives, and working knowledge of discrete mathematics will be helpful for taking this course; the Symmetric Cryptography course (recommended to be taken before this course) also discusses modulo arithmetic.

Das Ziel dieses Kurses besteht darin, Ihnen einen Plan und einen Rahmen zu geben, wie Finanzfachleute Entscheidungen treffen.

Wir werden die Grundlagen der Finanzbewertung behandeln, den Zeitwert des Geldes, aufgezinste Erträge sowie abgezinste zukünftige Erträge.  Sie werden die Discounted-Cash-Flow(DCF)-Bewertung verstehen und mit anderen Methoden vergleichen.  Außerdem versetzen wir uns in die Köpfe von Finanzmanagern von Großkonzernen und entwickeln die grundlegenden Tools der Investitionsrechnung.  Wir werden uns ansehen, wie, wann und wo Geld ausgegeben wird, werden Abwägungen in Bezug auf Investitionen, Wachstum, Dividenden und die Einhaltung einer gesunden Finanzdisziplin treffen.  Anschließend nehmen wir die Investitionsperspektive der Wall Street bzw. der Kapitalmärkte ein und besprechen die fundamentalen Abwägungen zwischen Risiko und Rendite.  Dann synthetisieren wir unsere Risikodiskussion mit unserem Bewertungsrahmen und nutzen sie für eine Reihe von direkten Anwendungen in der Praxis.

Für diesen Kurs sind keine Vorkenntnisse im Finanzwesen erforderlich.  Er soll vielmehr ein erster Schritt für jeden sein, der Aktienmärkte, Bewertung und Unternehmensfinanzierung verstehen möchte.  Wir werden sämtliche Tools und quantitativen Analysen zusammen durchgehen und einen Leitfaden entwickeln, um die scheinbar komplexen Entscheidungen von Finanzfachleuten verstehen zu können.

Many authors and pundits claimed that the world was converging towards a market-friendly democratic place, while gurus and consulting firms were rapidly producing formulae and advice on how to make profits out of the global economy. Decades later, new realities show that globalization does not necessarily mean political, cultural, and economic convergence and that, in fact, forces against it are strong.

In EKP1, titled ""Modernity and the Emergence of 'Korean' Philosophy,"" we explore how the Korean intellectual tradition encountered a pivotal moment of reinterpretation as it embraced the discipline of ""philosophy,"" often seen as the apex of modern European intellectual history. 
Looking at examples of Concept Clusters, we can see that Korean philosophy is deeply rooted in the Korean language and has formed a philosophical perspective that is different not only from the West but also from neighboring countries such as China and Japan. In this course, we also dealt with the early Korean Neo-Confucianism's gaze on “cheon”, referring to “heaven” as an example that clearly demonstrates the characteristics of Korean philosophy before it was given the name “philosophy.” Even before and after the advent of Neo-Confucianism, the search for ultimate existence – expressed in various terms – was constantly pursued.

To provide a space to think, learn, and feel about these concepts as realities connected to everyone, this course offers many entry points to deepen understandings about the U.S. as a current settler colonial nation, to engage with contemporary Indigenous Peoples/Native Nations, and to recognize how participants’ own lives, interests, and professional domains intersect with settler colonialism. 

This course highlights perspectives from Indigenous Peoples/Native Nations while focusing on examples of ongoing settler colonialism as it shows up in education, law, food systems, media, land, gender, race/ethnicity, and health/medicine, among others. 

Additionally, this course offers a framework consisting of four cornerstones that reveal how ongoing settler colonialism in the United States: 1) attempts to eliminate Indigenous Peoples, 2) imposes ideas of property, 3) produces anti-relationality, and 4) naturalizes the assumption of limited options. 

Through the framework + Native perspectives and knowledge, participants will better understand ongoing settler colonialism while (re)imagining anti-colonial processes in the U.S. as a way to co-create thriving futures for everyone.

Along the way, we encounter Perpetua and her martyrdom in Carthage; the struggles of Augustine the bishop in North Africa; the zeal of Celtic monks and missionaries; the viciousness of the Crusades; the visions of Brigit of Sweden; and the fracturing of Christianity by Martin Luther’s protest. We hear the voices of great theologians as well as of those branded heretics by the Church, a powerful reminder that the growth of Christianity is a story with many narratives of competing visions of reform and ideals, powerful critiques of corruption and venality, and exclusion of the vanquished.  The troubled history of Christian engagement with Jews and Muslims is found in pogroms and expulsions, but also in the astonishing ways in which the culture of the West was transformed by Jewish and Islamic learning.
 
We shall explore the stunning beauty of the Book of Kells, exquisitely prepared by monks as the Vikings terrorized the coast of England. We will experience the blue light of the windows of Chartres, and ponder the opening questions of Thomas Aquinas’ great Summa.

We will walk through the great Escorial of Philip II of Spain, hear the poetry of John of the Cross, and follow the Jesuits to Brazil and China.
 
Christianity in the West was forged in the fires of conflict and tumult, and it brought forth both creativity and violence. It echoed with calls for God’s world to be transformed, it inspired the most sublime art and architecture, yet it also revealed the power of the union of cross and sword to destroy. The course is a journey through the formation of the West as one strand of Christianity, as one chapter in a global story. It is a journey that has shaped our world."

#talkmentalillness curates the interviews from the Mental Health Experts series into an accessible learning experience that will help you have conversations about mental health. Talking about mental illness is both the content and desired outcome of this course, as you will use what you learn from my interviews with mental health experts to guide your own discussions about mental health challenges and treatments with family members, friends, colleagues, and other people in your life. The course will begin by presenting a core set of definitions for mental illness and analyzing the stigma associated with it. We will then apply these topics to specific psychological disorders, including anxiety and mood disorders, eating disorders, suicide, substance use, and psychosis. We will then consider how these issues disproportionately impact marginalized groups and communities of color. The course will conclude by considering innovative approaches to psychological treatments and how the pursuit and science of happiness inform mental health and wellness.
 
This course is part of a broader educational mission to share the science of mental illness with both students and the public, both locally and globally. I have designed and created it in collaboration with the Office for Academic Innovation and Libraries’ Media Services Team at the University of Colorado Boulder.

The course uses the languages ML, Racket, and Ruby as vehicles for teaching the concepts, but the real intent is to teach enough about how any language “fits together” to make you more effective programming in any language -- and in learning new ones.

This course is neither particularly theoretical nor just about programming specifics -- it will give you a framework for understanding how to use language constructs effectively and how to design correct and elegant programs. By using different languages, you will learn to think more deeply than in terms of the particular syntax of one language. The emphasis on functional programming is essential for learning how to write robust, reusable, composable, and elegant programs. Indeed, many of the most important ideas in modern languages have their roots in functional programming. Get ready to learn a fresh and beautiful way to look at software and how to have fun building it.

As explained in more detail in the first module of Part A, the overall course is a substantial amount of challenging material, so the three-part format provides two intermediate milestones and opportunities for a pause before continuing.  The three parts are designed to be completed in order and set up to motivate you to continue through to the end of Part C.  The three parts are not quite equal in length: Part A is almost as substantial as Part B and Part C combined.

An exciting two-spacecraft mission to Mars is considered where a primary mother craft is in communication with a daughter vehicle in another orbit.  The challenges include determining the kinematics of the orbit frame and several desired reference frames, numerically simulating the attitude dynamics of the spacecraft in orbit, and implementing a feedback control that then drives different spacecraft body frames to a range of mission modes including sun pointing for power generation, nadir pointing for science gathering, mother spacecraft pointing for communication and data transfer.  Finally, an integrated mission simulation is developed that implements these attitude modes and explores the resulting autonomous closed-loop performance. 

Tasks 1 and 2 use three-dimensional kinematics to create the mission related orbit simulation and the associated orbit frames.  The introductory step ensures the satellite is undergoing the correct motion, and that the orbit frame orientation relative to the planet is being properly evaluated.

Tasks 3 through 5 create the required attitude reference frame for the three attitude pointing modes called sun-pointing, nadir-pointing and GMO-pointing.  The reference attitude frame is a critical component to ensure the feedback control drives the satellite to the desired orientation.  The control employed remains the same for all three pointing modes, but the performance is different because different attitude reference frames are employed.  

Tasks 6 through 7 create simulation routines to first evaluate the attitude tracking error between a body-fixed frame and a particular reference frame of the current attitude mode.  Next the inertial attitude dynamics is evaluated through a numerical simulation to be able to numerically analyze the control performance.

Tasks 8-11 simulate the closed-loop attitude performance for the three attitude modes.  Tasks 8 through 10 first simulate a single attitude at a time, while tasks 11 develops a comprehensive attitude mission simulation which considers the attitude modes switching autonomously as a function of the spacecraft location relative to the planet."

The knowledge you will gain can truly change your outlook on our world.

""Economic Growth and Distributive Justice -  Maximizing Social Wellbeing"" is the second part of a two part course and it includes the following five lectures: 
(1) The excess burden of taxation
(2) Tax incidence: who bears the economic burden of tax?
(3) Progressivity: definition and ways to achieve
(4) Low Income, Low Ability and the Optimal Income Tax Model
(5) Designing the Tax and Transfer System that Maximizes Social Wellbeing
If you haven't done that already, we strongly recommend that you register for the first part of the course: ""Economic Growth and Distributive Justice - the Role of the State"". Taking both parts of the course would enable you to obtain a fuller and more comprehensive knowledge about Economic Growth and Distributed Justice.

The course is founded upon the elemental idea that the role of the state is to maximize the well-being - or simply the happiness - of its residents. In 9 fascinating, edifying lessons, using only simple words and decoding professional terminologies that sometimes baffle the intelligent layman, the course expounds many truths – both intuitive and unintuitive. Often using examples from the US and Europe, it does not however focus on policies in any particular region of the world, and is directly applicable to all countries around the globe.

The course touches upon the essence of important concepts like efficiency and equity, inequality and poverty, gross domestic product, tax evasion and tax planning; it presents the work of Nobel Laureate James Mirrlees and his followers - promoting a coherent system that integrates tax and government expenditures to maximize social welfare; and illuminates a range of high-profile issues from their economic angle:
• Climate change: the atmosphere and oceans as public goods, and how smart (Pigovian) taxation can be used to combat the rapidly increasing threats to our planet;
• Technology as the engine of economic growth;
• Taxing the rich: How can we mitigate the growing inequality problem? Should we   impose a global tax on capital?

The curriculum includes interviews with major figures in the fields of law and of economics:  Harvard's Elhanan Helpman, Dan Shaviro from NYU and Richard Epstein from the University of Chicago and NYU.

After successfully completing this course, you can expect to be able to:
• better understand economic issues presented in the media
• form an informed opinion on the strengths and weaknesses of presented social economic policies
• define and measure inequality and poverty
• define the connection between inequality (income, wealth) and economic growth
• explain the foundations of economic growth
• design a tax and transfer system to maximize the happiness of individuals

All these will allow you to better understand the policies being developed around you, and to play a larger, more informed role in their development, as a conscientious citizen.

Spesso i dati provengono da fonti diverse; dobbiamo quindi essere in grado di stabilire tra questi delle relazioni che ci permettano di includere in un’analisi tutte le informazioni di cui abbiamo bisogno. Vedremo quindi come costruire queste relazioni su Tableau, ricorrendo a Join, Union e Data Blending.

Lavoreremo con i campi calcolati e i parametri. I primi sono nuovi campi (dimensioni e misure) che, a partire dalla logica utilizzata, aggiungono nuovi dati al data base di partenza. I secondi, invece, sono valori dinamici che possono essere impiegati in tantissimi modi per personalizzare i propri calcoli e la loro visualizzazione all’interno dello spazio di lavoro.

Vedremo come Tableau esegue le operazioni di calcolo secondo un ordine preciso, che influisce sui risultati dei calcoli che facciamo. Andremo infine a lavorare con i dati geografici. Nel processo analitico, sono diverse le domande che possiamo porci. Padroneggiando le conoscenze sulla manipolazione dei dati geografici possiamo rispondere al “dove”, un aspetto fondamentale da considerare nel processo analitico."

Dans l'AVC ischémique, le type d'AVC le plus courant, le premier objectif est de rétablir la circulation cérébrale par un traitement thrombolytique avec rTPA intraveineux et, s'il n'est pas efficace ou s'il existe des contre-indications médicales, par traitement endovasculaire. Dans l'AVC hémorragique, il existe également des traitements spécifiques qui peuvent améliorer son pronostic. 

L'avantage de toutes les thérapies disponibles dans l'AVC aigu est d'autant plus grand que le traitement est commencé tôt. C'est pourquoi l'organisation de systèmes Code Ictus coordonnés entre les systèmes d'urgence médicale et les hôpitaux est cruciale pour obtenir le meilleur traitement possible des patients victimes d'un AVC aigu de manière rapide.

De plus, les échelles d'évaluation neurologique facilitent la reconnaissance de l'AVC aux niveaux hospitalier et préhospitalier et fournissent de précieux renseignements sur la gravité de l'AVC. En ce sens, l'échelle RACE est une échelle préhospitalière validée comme outil d'identification des patients ayant subi l'AVC le plus grave, dont on soupçonne une occlusion vasculaire, candidats à un traitement endovasculaire.

541,Fq__yk2bEeS5fSIACy-OMw,Introduction to Systems Biology,systems-biology,"This course will introduce the student to contemporary Systems Biology focused on mammalian cells, their constituents and their functions. Biology is moving from molecular to modular. As our knowledge of our genome and gene expression deepens and we develop lists of molecules (proteins, lipids, ions) involved in cellular processes, we need to understand how these molecules interact with each other to form modules that act as discrete functional systems. These systems underlie core subcellular processes such as signal transduction, transcription, motility and electrical excitability. In turn these processes come together to exhibit cellular behaviors such as secretion, proliferation and action potentials. What are the properties of such subcellular and cellular systems? What are the mechanisms by which emergent behaviors of systems arise? What types of experiments inform systems-level thinking? Why do we need computation and simulations to understand these systems?

The course will develop multiple lines of reasoning to answer the questions listed above. Two major reasoning threads are: the design, execution and interpretation of multivariable experiments that produce large data sets; quantitative reasoning, models and simulations. Examples will be discussed to demonstrate “how” cell- level functions arise and “why” mechanistic knowledge allows us to predict cellular behaviors leading to disease states and drug responses."

Human structure is important to all of us as it has been for millennia.  Artists, teachers, health care providers, scientists and most children try to understand the human form from stick figure drawings to electron microscopy. Learning the form of people is of great interest to us – physicians, nurses, physician assistants, emergency medical services personnel and many, many others.

Learning anatomy classically involved dissection of the deceased whether directly in the laboratory or from texts, drawings, photographs or videos.  There are many wonderful resources for the study of anatomy.  Developing an understanding of the human form requires significant work and a wide range of resources.

In this course, we have attempted to present succinct videos of human anatomy.  Some will find these images to be disturbing and these images carry a need to respect the individual who decided to donate their remains to benefit our teaching and learning.

All of the dissections depicted in the following videos are from individuals who gave their remains to be used in the advancement of medical education and research after death to the Yale School of Medicine.

The sequence of videos is divided into classic anatomic sections.  Each video has a set of learning objectives and a brief quiz at the end.  Following each section there is another quiz covering the entire section in order for you to test your knowledge.  

We hope these videos will help you better understand the human form, make time that you may have in the laboratory more worthwhile if you have that opportunity and help you develop an appreciation of the wonderful intricacies of people.

556,4bUuohtdEe6clRKgJZnk6w,Ciencia de datos energéticos,ciencia-de-datos-energticos,"La ciencia de datos puede entenderse como la aplicación del potencial de la ciencia de datos en la búsqueda de soluciones novedosas a problemas del sector energético. Este curso busca facilitar la comprensión de cómo es ese proceso y, para ello, se enfoca exclusivamente en el subsector de la energía eléctrica. 

Para desarrollar un proyecto de ciencia de datos energéticos se necesita que confluyan dos tipos de conocimiento: por una parte, un conocimiento sobre el sector eléctrico (cómo es su estructura, cuáles son sus principales retos, cómo funciona) y , por otra, un conocimiento sobre la ciencia de datos (cuáles son sus fundamentos, cómo opera, qué tipo de aportes puede dar). Por esa razón, es usual que se constituyan equipos interdisciplinarios en los que confluyen tanto expertos en energía como expertos en análisis de datos. 

No es fácil para estos expertos poder dialogar, porque el conocimiento especializado suele tener también un lenguaje especializado y no es fácil compartir la experticia con personas que no son especialistas en nuestro campo de conocimiento. 

Justamente, este curso busca ayudar a facilitar ese diálogo y a sobrepasar esas barreras de comunicación. 

Para ello, lo que haremos será presentar los elementos básicos, fundamentales de cada una de las dos áreas del conocimiento con una perspectiva más amplia que profunda. El propósito es el de adquirir una comprensión de alto nivel de tanto los elementos del sector eléctrico como de la ciencia de datos. Aspiramos que, al finalizar exitosamente este curso, usted pueda entender y explicar cómo funciona el proceso de ciencia de datos aplicado a los problemas del sector eléctrico.

¿Cómo está estructurado el curso? El curso tiene seis módulos y en cada uno de esos módulos trabajamos un tema del área de energía y un tema del área de ciencia de datos, que confluyen en una aplicación concreta o, al menos, en una etapa de una aplicación concreta. En cada módulo, usted encontrará:
- videos explicativos
- un laboratorio no calificado
- un laboratorio calificado
- un cuestionario calificado.

Los laboratorios son espacios para desarrollar tareas en lenguaje Python. No esperamos que usted sea un experto desarrollador de programas en Python, pero sí que tenga algún tipo de experticia en programación. 

¿Para quién es este curso? Hemos imaginado este curso teniendo en mente dos posibles perfiles:
1) un perfil de alguien con conocimientos sobre el sector energético que quiere explorar qué puede aprovechar de la ciencia de datos; y
2) un perfil de alguien con conocimientos en ciencia de datos que quiere explorar cómo puede aportar esos conocimientos en el área del sector energético. Por ej.: Este curso está dedicado principalmente a estudiantes universitarios de primer y segundo año interesados en ciencia e ingeniería, junto con estudiantes de secundaria y profesionales interesados en programación."

For example, mobile devices increase convenience but often bypass traditional security measures. After this course, you will be able to describe how the nature of the threat evolves, as culprits employ a burgeoning set of sophisticated tools to take advantage of our growing reliance on networks for critical-data exchange.

If you want to pursue a career in the public sector, the stakes are high as well. The proliferation of hackers, inevitable human errors, bring-your-own-device (BYOD) initiatives, and the ever-broadening need to share information weigh heavily on government and education organizations, and consume substantial resources. The Pentagon, for example, has proposed to spend $23 billion on network security initiatives through 2018. This sounds like a large sum, until you consider the scope and importance of the U.S. government information resources this investment must protect.

After completing the course modules you will be able to explain how yesterday’s prevention strategies are no longer adequate for stopping advanced, targeted attacks.

It shows how all chronic diseases (obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cancer) are related by a set of common causes, and that such diseases should be tackled, not individually, but as part of a complex system, with interrelated contributing factors. These factors are genetic, environmental, psychological, economic, social, developmental, and media related. 

The Charles Perkins Centre at the University of Sydney is a unique interdisciplinary education and research hub which seeks solutions to chronic disease through a complex systems approach. Academics in many disciplines (in Science and Medicine, but also in Architecture, Humanities, Law etc)  work in a collaborative fashion to produce novel solutions to the problems of chronic disease.  All contributors and participants in this course are members of the Charles Perkins Centre and will  speak from the unique interdisciplinary perspective that this Centre affords. 

The course will describe a complex systems approach as the most productive way to ease the burden of chronic disease. It then describes  these diseases in detail, their risk factors, and the environmental and biological factors that have led to the  current epidemic of  obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Finally, the solutions – and more importantly the process for finding solutions- is the subject of the last module. No one approach by itself can ever be the answer, and certainly not a simple diet and exercise approach. 

The entire course consists of 5 content modules, plus an extra module for completing assignments and discussions, and takes about 6 weeks to complete. Completion certificates are issued on the basis of participation in all 6 modules. 

What you'll learn: 
-	How the Charles Perkins Centre recruits interdisciplinary teams to ease the burden of chronic disease
-	How a complex systems approach is necessary to provide solutions to a complex problem
-	The fundamentals of chronic disease research and where it is heading
-	The biggest risk factors for chronic disease and their global incidence
-	The biological, genetic, social, regulatory, and other influences that have inflated these risk factors
-	How to provide solutions globally for the reduction of chronic disease"

Of course, there is always a person or multiple persons in the company who can give those answers, but there is a much better way of providing your colleagues with information they need then chasing those all-knowing employees for answers, and that is a fully automated chatbot created with Power Virtual Agent, which is one of the 4 main parts of the Power Platform.

In this 35-minutes long guided project, “Use SharePoint & Power Virtual Agent to Create Smart Chatbot”, you will create a SharePoint site and list, add some data to it and create a Power Virtual Agent chatbot which will automate the information flow from your company to the employees. Once the chatbot is up and running, you and your colleagues won’t have to bother other colleagues in person or send them emails or texts anymore, you will be able to have a nice and easy-going conversation with the bot behind the chatbot and find out the information you need. Since this project uses Office 365 services like SharePoint and Power Virtual Agent (part of the Microsoft Power Platform), you will need access to a Microsoft account and a Microsoft 365 Developer Program subscription account. In the video at the beginning of the project you will be given instructions on how to sign up for both.

If you are ready to create your artificial co-worker which will help you and your colleagues provide information to others, then this project is for you! Let's get started!"

Mountains are recognized as particularly sensitive physical environments where intense and rapid changes have in the past, and may increasingly in the future, place pressure on their resource base. 

In this context, a team of roughly 100 experts worked from 2008 to 2013 for the European ACQWA project (www.acqwa.ch) which was coordinated by the University of Geneva. The primary objectives of the project were to assess the impacts of a changing climate on the quantity and quality of water originating in mountain regions, particularly where snow- and ice melt represent a large, sometimes the largest, streamflow component. A further objective of the project was to determine the potential disruptions to water-dependent economic activities related to the climate impacts on hydrological systems, and to propose a portfolio of possible adaptation strategies.

This particular MOOC is inspired by the ACQWA Project and offers a better understanding of climate change, its impacts on the quality and quantity of water in mountain regions and the risks related to changing water resources. From an interdisciplinary perspective, the participation of twenty-five instructors from five different countries (Switzerland, England, South Korea, India and Nepal) and fourteen institutions (UNIGE, RTS, UNIFR, UZH, ETHZ, Meteodat GmbH, WGMS, Imperial College London, Agroscope, République et Canton de Genève, Yonsei University, IHCAP, ICIMOD, SDC, FOEN) highlights the diversity of both theoretical and practical viewpoints related to these issues.

By the end of this course, you will be able :

- to define the general concept of climate change in mountain regions
- to understand the concepts associated with climate change such as adaptation and water governance strategies
- to consider the impacts of climate change on water resources in mountain regions
- to identify the impacts of climate change on hydropower, agriculture, aquatic ecosystems and health 
- to enumerate risks that can occur in mountain areas and lead to disruptions in water availability and use.

Your acquired knowledge will be evaluated through multiple-choice quizzes at the end of each unit of the course.

This MOOC on “Climate Change and Water in Mountain Regions : A Global Concern” was initiated and financed by the University of Geneva, through its Institute for Environmental Sciences.

So, why inbound?

Inbound is a fundamental shift in the way you do business. Instead of an interruption-based message where the marketer or salesperson had all the control, inbound is about empowering potential customers. Consumer’s buying behaviors have changed and will continue to change. That's the driving force behind inbound. What your customers want today is different than what they wanted 10 years ago. That means you need to change the way you market, sell, and service to match the way people actually want to shop and buy.

So, wondering what to expect in this course?

After an initial lesson on an introduction to the inbound fundamentals, the course consists of a set of lessons that follows the inbound methodology. The inbound methodology illustrates the four stages that make an inbound business. It reflects the entire inbound marketing, sales, services, and relationship process. The stages are Attract, Convert, Close, and Delight.

703,c8ICsd1SEeavSQqUZOzWHA,A Business Approach to Sustainable Landscape Restoration,landscape-restoration-sustainable-development,"Integrated landscape management and large-scale landscape restoration should be in every company’s business strategy because in order to reach the Sustainable Development Goal on Land Degradation Neutrality (SDG Number 15.3) scaling up and acceleration of business-driven landscape restoration is urgently needed.

This requires business professionals with a vision, the right knowledge and skills. This MOOC aims to train the next generation of business professionals and developers to acknowledge business’ interdependency with healthy landscapes and understand the value of ecosystem resources.

“Historically, we have found countless ways to justify our continued exploitation of the environment: discovery, tradition, Manifest Destiny, even Chinese hoax. But we’re all out of excuses now. Each passing day swells the data on greenhouse gases and extreme weather, shrinking reservoirs and rising sea levels, and diminishing biodiversity. Our resources are finite, the window for change if not firmly shut, is certainly closing, and all life must adapt or be doomed.”

Téa Obreht, 
The New Yorker, Dec. 19&26, 2016, p. 106.

It is a frightening prospect indeed – that all life on Earth must either adapt or be doomed. This course is about landscape degradation – a global and wicked problem that is contributing to the dooming prospect of depletion of Earth’s finite resources. But this course is also about the solutions to this problem – business driven landscape restoration.
So rather than leaving you powerless with the prospect Obreht puts fowards above, it is our hope that you learn how you can be part of the solution to making sure that Planet Earth still provides a safe and habitable home for future generations. 
We must act big and we must act now.
With this course we want to pass on valuable knowledge and teach you useful skills that you can apply in your professional life that will enable you to tackle the issue of landscape degradation and restoration. 
The issue is urgent, so let’s dive right into it.

This MOOC is developed by the ENABLE partnership, which is co-funded by the ERASMUS+ programme of the European Commission and involves a diverse, international group of organizations including Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University, Commonland, United Nations University Land Restoration Training Programme, the Spanish National Research Council and Estoril Global Conferences."

716,PlY4xMN1EeuBnwpnLFLhFQ,Chronically Ill in an Emergency: Why Mental Health Matters,mental-health-emergencies,"In humanitarian settings, mental ill-health is powerfully inter-connected with other non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as cardiovascular diseases, cancers, diabetes and chronic respiratory diseases. Integrating mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) with NCD prevention and care might therefore be useful, both to be more effective, and to require fewer resources. There is, however, a lack of widely accepted guidelines that take this into account, and this course is intended to draw attention to that issue.

Attention to NCDs focused initially on four major disease categories (cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease and cancer) and four groups of associated risk factors (unhealthy diets, physical inactivity, tobacco use, and harmful use of alcohol). Recently, mental ill-health has been considered as the fifth NCD and environmental determinant as the fifth risk factor for NCDs – known as ‘5-by-5’ conditions. 

The course has a threefold aim: i) to explore evidence of interaction between mental ill-health and other NCDs and the role of psychosocial support in humanitarian response; ii) to explore what is being done and where; what level the determinants of health are being addressed at and the integration of mental health and psychosocial support or MHPSS and NCD prevention and care in humanitarian response; and iii) to identify and explore challenges, opportunities and lessons learned for integrating MHPSS and NCD prevention and care in humanitarian response.

Desde su surgimiento en los años 50 del siglo XX hasta la explosión de la actual pandemia provocada por el COVID-19, la UE no ha cesado de ampliar su radio de acción llegando a difuminar, en muchas áreas, la tradicional distinción entre asuntos internos y externos de los Estados nacionales.

Aún, debiendo hacer frente a un número creciente de posiciones críticas y escépticas respecto al proceso de integración, la Unión sigue siendo un referente clave para los ciudadanos. Así lo refleja, por ejemplo, el Eurobarómetro de junio de 2020, en el que el 66% de los europeos consideraba que la UE debería tener más competencias para combatir los efectos de la pandemia.

Ante las contradicciones de la globalización, comprender cómo estos procesos de cesión progresiva de soberanía y puesta en común de la toma de decisiones producen efectos reales sobre la ciudadanía constituye uno de los retos más interesantes de las ciencias políticas, las relaciones internacionales y el análisis de las políticas públicas. 

Este curso ha sido elaborado por la Cátedra Jean Monnet en Políticas Europeas de la UAB y cofinanciado por el Programa Erasmus+ de la UE. Su principal objetivo consiste en ilustrar el funcionamiento de la UE como sistema político sui generis, mediante un análisis crítico y detallado de su origen y desarrollo histórico, diseño institucional y principales políticas públicas.

El curso se dirige a un público amplio que quiere aprender y entender de qué manera se definen e implementan las políticas públicas a escala europea y doméstica, cuáles son sus principales actores, así como las dinámicas que rigen las relaciones entre las instituciones de la UE y los gobiernos de los Estados miembros. 

Los módulos han sido diseñados con el objetivo de ofrecer una visión de conjunto sobre el proceso de integración, a partir del análisis de los principales hitos históricos, del rol de cada una de las principales instituciones de la UE y del impacto del derecho europeo en las arenas nacionales. Complementando, además, la perspectiva teórica con las visiones más aplicadas del proceso de integración, el curso selecciona algunas de los ámbitos políticos más relevantes para observar la ‘UE en acción’, tanto a nivel interno (por ejemplo, economía, política agraria, política de cohesión o política ambiental), como a nivel externo (posición internacional de la UE, cooperación al desarrollo, comercio exterior, entre otros).

The focus will be on the moments of paradigm shift from one mode of rationality to another. For each of these moments, cultural facts and artifacts—thought, literature, ritual—will be examined in relationship to changing social, political, and economic systems.

The first two courses will cover the periods of the Warring States (481-256 BCE) and the Period of Division (220-589 CE), with a brief excursion into the Han (206 BCE-220 CE). The Warring States laid the social and cultural foundations for the emergence of the imperial mode of rationality; the Period of Division saw the Buddhist “conquest” of China and the emergence of a rationality defined by the opposition of the Three Teachings to shamanism, that is, of a clear contrast between elite and popular culture.

The third and fourth courses will focus on the emergence of modern China in the Song-Yuan (960-1368) and of today’s China 1850 to the present. We will see how the modern attack on religion, redefined as ""superstition"", led not only to religious reform movements but also to a society in which science and the nation became the primary value systems promoted by the state.

The courses are listed below:

A Critical Cultural History of China - Early China I: Intellectual Change in the Warring States and Han (481 BCE-220 CE)

You will learn to use Keras' functional API to create a multi output model which will be trained to learn two different labels given the same input example. The model will have one input but two outputs. A few of the shallow layers will be shared between the two outputs, you will also use a ResNet style skip connection in the model. If you are familiar with Keras, you have probably come across examples of models that are trained to perform multiple tasks. For example, an object detection model where a CNN is trained to find all class instances in the input images as well as give a regression output to localize the detected class instances in the input. Being able to use Keras' functional API is a first step towards building complex, multi-output models like object detection models.

We will be using TensorFlow as our machine learning framework. The project uses the Google Colab environment. You will need prior programming experience in Python. You will also need prior experience with Keras. Consider this to be an intermediate level Keras project. This is a practical, hands on guided project for learners who already have theoretical understanding of Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, and optimization algorithms like gradient descent but want to understand how to use use Keras to write custom, more complex models than just plain sequential neural networks.

And how do we explore the idea of progress around public sites of memory? This Teach-Out is an invitation to think about what progress means, and how you can look for it wherever you are—in your city, community, or neighborhood—and reflect upon your own ideas about the place you live in.

Changes in the built environment of our communities are themselves the result of human actions and intentions, such as municipal planning, commercial enterprises, or communities transforming their own space. In other words, in our cities we can see the results of our plans—our attempts to create and shape the future. Neighbors, political groups, corporations, governments, schools, and other organizations, they all shape the community, leaving traces that allow us to see in what directions they transformed our lives. 

This Teach-Out will ask the following questions:
•	What are the forces that shape and change the places we inhabit? 
•	How do people connect with places in our modern cities? 
•	Do places progress? 
•	How can we measure in them whether there is any “progress”? 

We will interview a number of people who work in Atlanta, Georgia, but the questions and places we will see here are comparable to many of other places in the world on what it means to progress. In this Teach-Out you will learn how to find the history of public spaces in any community and how to reflect upon the idea of progress. Finally, you can join a conversation to discuss what has been explored, uncovered, and possibly transformed both within ourselves and our communities.

A Teach-Out is: 
– an event – it takes place over a fixed, short period of time 
– an opportunity – it is open for free participation to everyone around the world 
– a community – it will be joined by a large number of diverse individuals 
– a conversation – an opportunity to give and take ideas and information from people 

This community learning event invites participants from around the world to come together in conversation with the Emory campus community, including faculty experts. This Teach-Out is part of Emory’s commitment to engage the local and global community in exploring and understanding problems, events, and phenomena most important to our society. 

Originating from University of Michigan (Teach-Out.org), Teach-Outs are short learning experiences focused on a specific current issue. Attendees will come together over a few days not only to learn about a subject or event but also to gain skills. Teach-Outs are open to the world and are designed to bring together individuals with wide-ranging perspectives in respectful and deep conversation. These events are an opportunity for diverse learners and a multitude of experts to come together to ask questions of one another and explore new solutions to the pressing concerns of our global community. Come, join the conversation!"

830,dNFBImQ8Ee64Ug5N_Fbraw,Pipe Material Specification ,pipe-material-specification,"This particular course entitled “Pipe Material Specification” under the specialization entitled “Design of Industrial Piping Systems”  is mainly aimed at piping system design aspects. The major differences between tube and pipe should be known to the designer first. The right selection of the straight pipe for a given process requirement is entirely based on the sound knowledge of the designer on pipe manufacturing techniques, pipe ends, pipe materials, and ASME B31 pressure piping series. Designers should be capable of determining the pipe wall thickness for the internal pressure as well as external pressure based on the ASME B31.3 code and selecting of proper schedule number from the ASME B36.10M  and B36.19M standards. Piping is composed of pipe fittings, valves, flanges, gaskets, nuts and bolts, etc. Therefore, designers should be acquainted with various types of fittings, importance, ends, pressure-temperature ratings, and material. Similarly, designers should be acquainted with various types of flanges, ends, face finishing, pressure-temperature ratings, materials, and similar knowledge on gaskets and nuts and bolting. Valves are used for isolation, regulation, and one-way operations. Therefore, types, end connections, material, pressure-temperature ratings,  internal construction, internal parts, and functioning of valves should be known to the designer for their right selection. PFDs, P&IDs, General Arrangement Drawings (GADs), and Piping Isometrics are important drawings for any process plant; and development, reading, and interpreting these drawings is one of the desired requirements that the designer should possess. To fulfill this requirement the designer should be thorough with certain symbols used to present a three-plane piping system on a 2D sheet such as GADs, etc. The designers must familiarize themselves with general abbreviations, service codes, line number identification, ‘insulation and heat tracing codes’, representations of pipelines, boundaries, off-page connectors, pipe fittings, piping valves, piping components, and ‘fire, and safety’. In a nutshell, the designer should be thorough with the legend sheet of a particular industry.
The flexibility of a piping system is a major issue and it is dicey if the piping system doesn’t have inherent flexibility. Therefore, designers should be masters in all aspects of pipe stress analysis and perform flexibility analysis using industry-accepted pipe stress analysis software. They should be in a position to suggest the optimum pipe routing with appropriate supports, hangers, and expansion joints. To become an expert in flexibility analysis the designer should be well familiar with various types of primary supports, secondary supports, various types of hangers, good practices followed in piping and equipment layout known as layout rules, and expansion joints. Further, it is a requirement expected from the designer, i.e., the design of jacketed piping.  Vibration-induced loads are to be included in the pipe flexibility analysis. Unless the designer knows the sources for pipe vibration and types; the effect of vibration cannot be captured in the stress analysis process. The piping system needs insulation and a thorough knowledge of the types, shapes, and materials is essential. Pipes may be routed through underground. Therefore, designers should be capable of making the decision when the underground piping is preferred. If preferred, the designer should know what sort of challenges going to be faced that arise from corrosion and land sliding, and what are remedial solutions.  Hence, designers should know about proper cathodic protection as it is one of the remedial solutions to prevent the UG pipe.
The course is aimed to address all these aspects and these essential topics are included in the course. These are explained and demonstrated in a lucid form therefore, the learners can easily grasp the concepts and acquire the required skillset as mentioned above."

En este curso podrás identificar las características de quienes ejercen el liderazgo, que durante muchos años fue considerado como una habilidad innata, no adquirida y conforme a ciertos rasgos de la personalidad de algunos individuos. Sin embargo, las investigaciones, entre ellas la del Dr. Roberto Vola Luhrs en su libro “Lo que sobra es el Talento"", han demostrado que determinadas circunstancias favorecen al desarrollo de estas habilidades en algunos individuos. Según esto, al líder lo hacen también las situaciones, por lo tanto, los estilos de liderazgo deben ser acordes con las circunstancias. 

El rol del líder implica gestionar individuos y estos no son todos iguales. El liderazgo es circunstancial y para ello se requiere de capacidad y habilidades que permitan al líder evaluar las situaciones particulares y variar su estilo de liderazgo de acuerdo con ellas, es decir, no se debe permanecer estático.  

Recorriendo este curso lograrás tener un criterio para reconocer los tipos de liderazgo y la importancia de la comunicación, su complejidad e influencia directa sobre los modelos mentales y las reacciones de las personas, pues la incorrecta descodificación de un mensaje resultará en un error o confusión posterior, que afectará el sentido de la comunicación.

Since philosophers love truth, they deplore these tendencies. But what can they do about them?
In this course, you will be invited to reflect on whether, in what sense and to what extent, 2500 years of normative epistemology, or theory of knowledge, can be put into practice and help to reduce truth decay. You’ll be invited, more specifically, to reflect on
- the theory of knowledge,
- the analysis of knowledge,
- the possibility of knowledge,
- the structure of knowledge,
- the kinds of knowledge, and
- the value of knowledge.

In the first half of the course, we would like to ask how an individual's genome differs from the ""reference genome"" of the species. Our goal is to take small fragments of DNA from the individual and ""map"" them to the reference genome.  We will see that the combinatorial pattern matching algorithms solving this problem are elegant and extremely efficient, requiring a surprisingly small amount of runtime and memory.

In the second half of the course, we will learn how to identify the function of a protein even if it has been bombarded by so many mutations compared to similar proteins with known functions that it has become barely recognizable.  This is the case, for example, in HIV studies, since the virus often mutates so quickly that researchers can struggle to study it.  The approach we will use is based on a powerful machine learning tool called a hidden Markov model.

Finally, you will learn how to apply popular bioinformatics software tools applying hidden Markov models to compare a protein against a related family of proteins."

This is an increasingly pressing question for all actors of our society.

Big companies, SMEs, start-ups but also charities and public actors, the circular economy is part of solutions to be deployed at a large scale by all these actors, to promote an economy that respects planet boundaries, consumes less natural resources, emits less greenhouse gases and produces less waste.
With this MOOC, you will understand the limits of the linear economy, based on the ""Take-Make-Waste"" principle, as well as the need for a shift towards circular economy.

Circular Economy has long been confined to the recycling and waste management sector. Now, we must realize its systemic nature, in all sectors and the role of each organization in its deployment.

To clarify your thoughts, we have met 3 companies, from various sectors, who are very committed to the subject. They will share with you their journey to transform their business model into a circular one. We will also meet some start-ups, SMEs and actors of the social and solidarity economy, to better understand the role and necessary cooperation between those actors to move from a linear to a circular economy.

We have made this MOOC with the consultancy agency in strategy Circulab, which helps organisations to create circular and regenerative solutions. Circulab will give you pedagogical content, in order to understand what is the circular economy, how it is embodied today within organisations and what are challenges to take up to deploy it at a larger scale."

Auf persönlicher Ebene verhandeln wir unter anderem mit Freunden, Familie, Vermietern, Autoverkäufern und Arbeitgebern. Verhandlungen sind auch der Schlüssel zum Geschäftserfolg. Kein Unternehmen kann ohne profitable Verträge überleben. Innerhalb eines Unternehmens kann Verhandlungsgeschick zu Ihrem beruflichen Aufstieg führen. 

Ich hoffe, dass Sie sich den Hunderttausenden von Lernenden anschließen, die „Erfolgreiches Verhandeln“ zu einem der beliebtesten und am höchsten bewerteten MOOCs weltweit gemacht haben.  Im Kurs lernen Sie die vier Schritte einer erfolgreichen Verhandlung kennen und üben diese: 

   (1) Vorbereiten: Planen Sie Ihre Verhandlungsstrategie 

   (2) Verhandeln: Verwenden Sie Schlüsseltaktiken für den Erfolg 

   (3) Schließen: Erstellen Sie den Vertrag 

   (4) Ausführen und bewerten: Das Endspiel 

Um diesen Kurs erfolgreich abzuschließen und Ihre Verhandlungsfähigkeit zu verbessern, müssen Sie Folgendes tun: 

(1) Sehen Sie sich die kurzen Videos an (zwischen 5 und 20 Minuten). Die Videos sind interaktiv und enthalten Fragen, mit denen Sie Ihr Verständnis der Verhandlungsstrategie und -fähigkeiten testen können. Sie können Videos schneller oder langsamer abspielen, um sie an Ihr bevorzugtes Zuhör-Tempo anzupassen. Abhängig von Ihrem Zeitplan können Sie sich die Videos über einige Wochen hinweg ansehen oder alle sofort ansehen. Ein Kursteilnehmer, der sich gleich alles angesehen hatte, kam zu dem Schluss, dass „es so gut sei wie Breaking Bad“. Ein anderer Kursteilnehmer verglich den Kurs mit „House of Cards“.  In beiden Serien gibt es interessante Beispiele für komplexe Verhandlungen!

(2) Testen Sie Ihre Verhandlungsfähigkeiten, indem Sie die Verhandlung in Modul 6 abschließen. Sie können mit einem Freund vor Ort verhandeln oder mithilfe von „Diskussionen“ einen Partner aus einem anderen Teil der Welt finden. Ihr Verhandlungspartner gibt Ihnen Feedback zu Ihren Verhandlungsfähigkeiten. Um Sie bei Ihren Verhandlungen zu unterstützen, habe ich mehrere kostenlose Verhandlungsplanungstools entwickelt, die sich auf den Kurs beziehen.  Diese Tools und eine kostenlose App sind unter http://negotiationplanner.com/ verfügbar.

The matrix representation and implicit solution of Lagrange’s equation are at the heart of this approach, in the framework of conservative structural systems, with Gaussian modes. 

The prototype of the continuous element being the prismatic beam - as an illustration, but with general value - and the implicit model/solution leads to the major place of natural eigenshapes in vibration and shocks theory and general dynamic representation of structures and foundations of the dynamic tests and certification.
In fact, this course is a perspective on the double vision of any dynamic structure, with the continuous point of view and a digital model in perspective.

At the end of this course, the physicist, the mechanical engineer, the specialist in control will have a general overview of the dynamic representation and implicit solution applicable in structural analysis and control of general dynamic systems.

1061,jnoxprrzEeW2iwpbOuagWQ,The Brain and Space,human-brain,"This course is about how the brain creates our sense of spatial location from a variety of sensory and motor sources, and how this spatial sense in turn shapes our cognitive abilities.

Knowing where things are is effortless.  But “under the hood,” your brain must figure out even the simplest of details about the world around you and your position in it.  Recognizing your mother, finding your phone, going to the grocery store, playing the banjo – these require careful sleuthing and coordination across different sensory and motor domains.  This course traces the brain’s detective work to create this sense of space and argues that the brain’s spatial focus permeates our cognitive abilities, affecting the way we think and remember.

The material in this course is based on a book I've written for a general audience.  The book is called ""Making Space: How the Brain Knows Where Things Are"", and is available from Amazon, Barnes and Noble, or directly from Harvard University Press. 

The course material overlaps with classes on perception or systems neuroscience, and can be taken either before or after such classes.

Dr. Jennifer M. Groh, Ph.D.

 www.duke.edu/~jmgroh

Jennifer M. Groh is interested in how the brain process spatial information in different sensory systems, and how the brain's spatial codes influence other aspects of cognition.  She is the author of a recent book entitled ""Making Space:  How the Brain Knows Where Things Are"" (Harvard University Press, fall 2014).

Much of her research concerns differences in how the visual and auditory systems encode location, and how vision influences hearing.  Her laboratory has demonstrated that neurons in auditory brain regions are sometimes responsive not just to what we hear but also to what direction we are looking and what visual stimuli we can see.  These surprising findings challenge the prevailing assumption that the brain’s sensory pathways remain separate and distinct from each other at early stages, and suggest a mechanism for such multi-sensory interactions as lip-reading and ventriloquism (the capture of perceived sound location by a plausible nearby visual stimulus).

Dr. Groh has been a professor at Duke University since 2006.  She received her undergraduate degree in biology from Princeton University in 1988 before studying neuroscience at the University of Michigan (Master’s, 1990), the University of Pennsylvania (Ph.D., 1993), and Stanford University (postdoctoral, 1994-1997).  Dr. Groh has been teaching undergraduate classes on the neural basis of perception and memory for over fifteen years.  She is presently a faculty member at the Center for Cognitive Neuroscience and the Duke Institute for Brain Sciences at Duke University.  She also holds appointments in the Departments of Neurobiology and Psychology & Neuroscience at Duke.

Dr. Groh’s research has been supported by a variety of sources including the John S. Guggenheim Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, and the Office of Naval Research Young Investigator Program, the McKnight Endowment Fund for Neuroscience, the John Merck Scholars Program, the EJLB Foundation, the Alfred P.

The Readings and other materials for Essentials of Global Health

For almost every session of Essentials of Global Health, you will see: 

- Required readings
- Recommended readings
- Recommended videos

We have selected a small number of readings for each session that are central to understanding the content of the session. We have put these under “required readings”.

For each required reading, we have also indicated how carefully you should read the material and on what parts of the material you should focus your attention.

In addition, we have selected some additional readings that would be very helpful to your understanding the content of each session. 

The first is a textbook, Global Health 101, third edition. This is a comprehensive introductory textbook that closely follows the content of this Essentials of Global Health course. We have indicated for each session what part of the book you should read. Using this textbook can be very valuable to your mastering the content of the course.

The second set of “recommended readings” is some additional readings, mostly from journal articles and reports. For these, too, we have indicated how carefully you should read the material and on what parts of the material you should focus your attention.

Learners should note that to access articles from The Lancet they will have to register with the Lancet, if they do not have online access to a library that has The Lancet. Once they are registered, they will be able to sign into The Lancet and access all of its free articles.

We have also indicated for most sessions one or two videos that relate to the topic of the session. These are meant to help the learner get a better feel for the topic which is being covered. Most learners will find the videos brief, easy and enjoyable to watch, and very enlightening."

Learner review: ""It was a great experience, I really enjoyed it.""

In Write Your First Novel, you’ll learn to break down your creative endeavor into components and you’ll discover a process that will allow you to do what few have done: produce and complete a full-length work of fiction in the form of a 50,000-word novel. 

Learner Review: ""You teach storytelling like no other teacher. I cannot put in words how much I appreciate it. This daily writing, and the product that comes with it, have been a great mental support during the pandemic time. Art is a support for life, as Stephen King said, and thanks to you I experienced it first-hand during this time. I think I will keep writing 500 words per night for the rest of my life. I owe it to you. You taught me how to write a novel, and it works every time.  Huge thanks, and wishing you all the best.""

I am a proponent of experiential learning (also known as active learning). My lectures are short and to the point, designed in a step-by-step process essential to your success as a writer. I will guide you, I will show you how to get there, hopefully I will inspire you. You will learn through your own activity - which is writing! I firmly believe that the only way to become a writer is to write, write, write! 
 
Learner review:  ""As a published author, I took this course to relearn the skills. I thoroughly enjoyed each and every lecture and quiz. This course was very, very helpful and the videos were very well executed. Cheers!""

Writing fiction is a truly beautiful thing. Putting your own words on a page to tell a story which enters your readers minds and allows them to share the thoughts, emotions and lives of your characters is a very satisfying, rewarding experience.

Learner review: ""BEST TEACHER EVER! LOVE THE COURSE."""

1078,Dta9_D8qEeeuygoU7FlITg,Assessment for Learning,assessmentforlearning,"For several decades now, assessment has become an increasingly pressing educational priority. Teacher and school accountability systems have come to be based on analysis of large-scale, standardized summative assessments. As a consequence, assessment now dominates most conversations about reform, particularly as a measure of teacher and school accountability for learner performance. Behind the often heated and at times ideologically gridlocked debate is a genuine challenge to address gaps in achievement between different demographically identifiable groups of students. There is an urgent need to lift whole communities and cohorts of students out of cycles of underachievement. For better or for worse, testing and public reporting of achievement is seen to be one of the few tools capable of clearly informing public policy makers and communities alike about how their resources are being used to expand the life opportunities for their children. This course is an overview of current debates about testing, and analyses the strengths and weaknesses of a variety of approaches to assessment. The course also focuses on the use of assessment technologies in learning. It will explore recent advances in computer adaptive and diagnostic testing, the use of natural language processing technologies in assessments, and embedded formative assessments in digital and online curricula. Other topics include the use of data mining, learning analytics and artificial intelligence in learning management systems and educational technology platforms. Participants will be required to consider issues of data access, privacy and the challenges raised by ‘big data’ including data persistency and student profiling.

The Bible refers to its gods, rulers, and pyramids. Neighboring cultures in the ancient Near East and Mediterranean wrote about its god-like kings and its seemingly endless supply of gold.  The Greeks and Romans describe aspects of Egypt's culture and history.

As the 19th century began, the Napoleonic campaign in Egypt highlighted the wonders of this ancient land, and public interest soared.  Not long after, Champollion deciphered Egypt's hieroglyphs and paved the way for other scholars to reveal that Egyptian texts dealt with medicine, dentistry, veterinary practices, mathematics, literature, and accounting, and many other topics. Then, early in the 20th century, Howard Carter discovered the tomb of Tutankhamun and its fabulous contents. Exhibitions of this treasure a few decades later resulted in the world's first blockbuster, and its revival in the 21st century has kept interest alive.

Join Dr. David Silverman, Professor of Egyptology at Penn, Curator in Charge of the Egyptian Section of the Penn Museum, and curator of the Tutankhamun exhibitions  on a guided tour of the mysteries and wonders of this ancient land.

This course offers learners the chance to encounter and appreciate behavior, moral standards and some of the material conditions surrounding Japanese artists in the nineteenth century, in order to renew our assumptions about what artistic “realism” is and what it meant.

Learners will walk away with a clear understanding of how society and the individual were conceived of and represented in early modern Japan. Unlike contemporary western art forms, which acknowledge their common debt as “sister arts” but remain divided by genre and discourse, Japanese visual and literary culture tended to combine, producing literary texts inspired by visual images, and visual images which would then be inscribed with poems and prose. Noticing and being able to interpret this indivisibility of visual/literary cultures is essential in understanding the social and psychological values embedded within the beauty of Japanese art."

After learning the different structure that financial markets can take and the key functions that these perform, learners will analyze how financial markets affect saving and investment decisions in an economy with no uncertainty. 
Then, learners will be introduced to expected utility theory, which will provide them with the key analytical tools to study choices under uncertainty. These tools will then be used to model and analyze portfolio choices: first, learners will study the so-called canonical portfolio problem, that is, the problem of an investor who has to choose how to allocate their wealth between a safe and a risky asset; then, they will study portfolio choices that involve multiple risky assets. 
The analysis of portfolio choices will allow learners to characterize and determine investors’ optimal demand for risky assets, which will lay the foundation for the analysis of the Capital Asset Pricing Model, a milestone for asset pricing and financial economics. 
The analysis of the CAPM will finally teach learners how to characterize equilibrium returns and asset prices in financial markets, also understanding the key forces that govern these key variables."

This course is built on the notion that the most exciting writing begins after the first draft. It is specifically for folks who believe that writing poems just to express oneself is like using the Internet just for email. After all, poetry can change the way you and your readers think of the world and its inhabitants; it can break new ground for language; turn a blank sheet of paper into a teeming concert of voices and music.

Though any of us may have the potential to make that happen, having an understanding of how several tools of poetic composition can be used (and audaciously “mis-used”) gives you more ways to try (and if we do this right, we might surprise ourselves most of all). 

We'll cover key poetic terms and devices by studying poems by a handful of modern and contemporary poets and then get a chance to try our own hand at writing new poem drafts from a select number of prompts. Throughout the course you will have the opportunity to workshop your poem drafts and get feedback on your work, working towards a more polished poem."

1191,A9j_fIs9EeqqKApmVF9_Gw,Retrieve Data using Single-Table SQL Queries,single-table-sql-queries,"In this course you’ll learn how to effectively retrieve data from a relational database table using the SQL language. 

We all know that most computer systems rely on at least one database to store data. Your tax information is stored in the database used by the Internal Revenue Service. Your phone stores your contacts’   names, addresses, email addresses, and phone numbers in a database. If you shop online, you’re viewing photos, descriptions, and prices of products that are stored in a database. Database designers go to great lengths to design databases so that the data can be stored securely and in an organized format. It’s important to note that the main reason they go to all that work is so that we can get the data back out again when we need it! That’s called “data retrieval”. 

Data is retrieved or read from a relational database by using a language called SQL to query (or question) the database. SQL is referred to as “the language of relational databases”. It can be used by itself or embedded in programs to retrieve data. Once the data is retrieved, it can be displayed on a web page or PC application, or even printed on paper. 

You’ll be practicing writing SQL queries using SQLiteStudio. 

Next time you go online and look up the daily special at your favorite restaurant, you can think about the fact that it’s likely that an SQL query was used behind the scenes to fetch that data and pop it up on your screen. By the end of this course, you’ll even have a pretty good idea what the query might have looked like!

1194,CPLPuDKiEeaGtRI0HQleow,"Understanding China, 1700-2000: A Data Analytic Approach, Part 2",understanding-china-history-part-2,"The purpose of this course is to summarize new directions in Chinese history and social science produced by the creation and analysis of big historical datasets based on newly opened Chinese archival holdings, and to organize this knowledge in a framework that encourages learning about China in comparative perspective.

Our course demonstrates how a new scholarship of discovery is redefining what is singular about modern China and modern Chinese history. Current understandings of human history and social theory are based largely on Western experience or on non-Western experience seen through a Western lens. This course offers alternative perspectives derived from Chinese experience over the last three centuries. We present specific case studies of this new scholarship of discovery divided into two stand-alone parts, which means that students can take any part without prior or subsequent attendance of the other part.

Part 1 (https://www.coursera.org/learn/understanding-china-history-part-1) focuses on comparative inequality and opportunity and addresses two related questions ‘Who rises to the top?’ and ‘Who gets what?’. 

Part 2 (this course) turns to an arguably even more important question ‘Who are we?’ as seen through the framework of comparative population behavior - mortality, marriage, and reproduction – and their interaction with economic conditions and human values. We do so because mortality and reproduction are fundamental and universal, because they differ historically just as radically between China and the West as patterns of inequality and opportunity, and because these differences demonstrate the mutability of human behavior and values.

1230,eU_6KuQWEeutMhLqB6BFnw,3D Reconstruction - Single Viewpoint ,3d-reconstruction---single-viewpoint,"This course focuses on the recovery of the 3D structure of a scene from its 2D images. In particular, we are interested in the 3D reconstruction of a rigid scene from images taken by a stationary camera (same viewpoint). This problem is interesting as we want the multiple images of the scene to capture complementary information despite the fact that the scene is rigid and the camera is fixed. To this end, we explore several ways of capturing images where each image provides additional information about the scene.

In order to estimate scene properties (depth, surface orientation, material properties, etc.) we first define several important radiometric concepts, such as, light source intensity, surface illumination, surface brightness, image brightness and surface reflectance. Then, we tackle the challenging problem of shape from shading - recovering the shape of a surface from its shading in a single image. Next, we show that if multiple images of a scene of known reflectance are taken while changing the illumination direction, the surface normal at each scene point can be computed. This method, called photometric stereo, provides a dense surface normal map that can be integrated to obtain surface shape. 

Next, we discuss depth from defocus, which uses the limited depth of field of the camera to estimate scene structure. From a small number of images taken by changing the focus setting of the lens, a dense depth of the scene is recovered. Finally, we present a suite of techniques that use active illumination (the projection of light patterns onto the scene) to get precise 3D reconstructions of the scene. These active illumination methods are the workhorse of factory automation. They are used on manufacturing lines to assemble products and inspect their visual quality. They are also extensively used in other domains such as driverless cars, robotics, surveillance, medical imaging and special effects in movies."

1249,SruyQcZpEeewQAoxdmVzyg,Building Fintech Startups in Emerging Markets,building-fintech-startups,"Starting a small business can be very rewarding. This course starts by asking “What is entrepreneurship?” to then begin applying commonly used business planning tools, such as design thinking and business model canvas. Design thinking is a methodology that encourages startups to focus on user-centric products and services. Topics like regulation, intellectual property, funding, and growth are covered as they relate to building startups.

Many of the entrepreneurship opportunities and especially those in emerging markets arise out of necessity, driven to solve a real need or a social problem. Thus emerging markets are often seen as offering huge opportunities for disruptive innovation. Entrepreneurship has contributed to economic growth and has been able to respond to social problems, helping some communities prosper. With the rise of fintech, financial solutions using technologies such as the cloud, blockchain, and machine learning have bypassed or partnered with established financial institutions to serve new markets. 

We invited some really interesting people in various stages of building their startups to explain their business development. We will be talking with Zlto (a digital currency), Yoco (mobile payments), Proof of Steak (alternative asset investment), and Kuba (a digital ‘middleman’ for small businesses) to name a few. 

As we will learn, there is no such thing as being ‘ready’ or, choosing the ‘perfect time’ to become an entrepreneur. You are already one, so let’s take the next steps on your entrepreneurial journey by joining your peers around the world on this course. This course is for everyone anywhere, not only those inspired by fintech in emerging markets."

- Characterize spatial objects and phenomena (spatial modeling) from the point of view of their positioning in space (coordinate systems and projections, spatial relationships) and according to their intrinsic nature (object or vector mode vs. image or raster mode);
- Use various data acquisition methods (direct measurement, georeferencing of images, digitization, existing data source, etc.);
- Use various geodata storage methods (simple files and relational databases);
- Use data modeling tools to describe and implement a database;
- Create queries in a query language and data manipulation.

The second part of the course deals with spatial analysis methods and georeferenced information representation techniques. In particular, you will learn how to:
- Analyze the spatial properties of discrete variables, for example by quantifying spatial autocorrelation;
- Work with continuous variables (sampling, interpolation and construction of isolines)
- Use digital elevation models (DEMs) and their derivatives (slope, orientation, etc.);
- Use geodata superposition techniques;
- Produce cartographic documents according to the rules of the semiology of graphics;
- Explore other forms of spatial representation (interactive cartography on the internet, 3D representations, and augmented reality).

1312,lFTTt_gKEeqbaxLwKNQgZQ,Effective Engagement of Civil Society in Development,effective-engagement-of-civil-society-in-development,"Civil society organizations (CSOs) are key actors in development that have valuable contributions to make. They play a multitude of roles - including in relation to humanitarian assistance, service-delivery, research and policy development, and pursuing accountability from governments and other stakeholders – all of which can significantly contribute to the realization of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). CSOs are expected to play a critical role in implementing the SDGs and in monitoring their progress. It is therefore urgent that CSOs meaningfully and effectively engage in development processes. But what is needed for CSOs to be able to do so? This Online Interactive Guidance offers some answers to that question. It takes participants through a history of the international commitments that call for this multi-stakeholder collaboration; what this means in practice for different development actors; and the benefits that can ensue through means of good practice examples from countries across the globe.

Learning objectives
Following the completion of the 5 modules of the Online Interactive Guidance, participants will be able to:
•	Describe the rationale behind the need to engage civil society in development processes;
•	Define the CSO enabling environment and CSO development effectiveness as key components to ensuring 
         effective engagement of CSOs in development;
•	Recall the international commitments on the CSO enabling environment and CSO development 
         effectiveness;
•	Distinguish the roles and responsibilities of different development actors in ensuring effective engagement 
        of CSOs in development;
•	Identify practical ways in which governments, donors and civil society can engage to create a CSO enabling 
        environment and ensure CSO development effectiveness;
•	Identify good practices for a CSO enabling environment and development effectiveness;
•	Indicate the benefits that can ensue from implementing good practices;
•	Translate the international commitments and apply these to their own context.

Methodology
This Online Interactive Guidance consists of five modules developed around the overall learning objectives. Each module starts with an animated video introducing the topic and is followed by good practice examples; insights from the field in the form of video interviews; in-depth readings; and an online activity. 

Set-up
The Online Guidance will lead participants through the modules that each play a part in creating an environment in which CSOs can meaningfully and effectively contribute to implementation and monitoring of international development processes. 
> Module 1 will examine the CSO-related commitments that the international community has subscribed to and will provide an introduction to the four ways in which these can be realized. 
> Module 2 will explore the means towards creating effective multi-stakeholder dialogue, which is key to creating a CSO enabling environment. 
> Module 3 will examine CSOs’ own responsibility in ensuring their effectiveness, accountability and transparency in their day-to-day operations.
> Module 4 will delve into how providers of official development cooperation can effectively work with and for CSOs. 
> Module 5 is the concluding module and will examine how a country’s rules and regulations can determine an enabling environment for CSOs to operate in. 

Completion
Participants who have completed the 5 modules can request a certificate extended by the Task Team on CSO Development Effectiveness & Enabling Environment."

Los objetivos de la introducción a la Biología tienen como fines entre otros:
1. Conocer la constitución de la materia viva;
2. Estudiar la organización de los distintos seres vivos;
3. Estudiar las funciones que éstos realizan.

También se incursiona en los fundamentos de Física y Química, ambas desde hace tiempo muy relacionadas entre sí, mencionando como ejemplo que, en 1827, el francés Fourier observó en particular el dióxido de carbono, retenía
el calor atmosférico. Más tarde en 1903 el físico sueco Arrhenius, construyó la teoría general del efecto invernadero del calentamiento planetario. Esto nos muestra que Física, Química y Medio Ambiente mantienen una fructífera colaboración, que dura hasta nuestros días.

Finalmente cabe destacar que fue necesario también incorporar la más nueva; las Estadísticas Ambientales, incorporada en nuestra región después de la “Convención Sobre Acceso a la Información, Participación del Público en la Toma de Decisiones y el Acceso a la Justicia en Asuntos Ambientales” o conocida también como Convención de Aarhus (1999).

Dans les médias, la philanthropie est incarnée aujourd’hui par les milliardaires américains Bill Gates et Warren Buffet qui ont donné une grande part de leur fortune à une fondation en faveur de la santé et de l’éducation. Mais cette vision est partielle : la philanthropie est très active dans la plupart des régions du monde, pas seulement aux Etats-Unis, et ce ne sont pas seulement les très riches qui donnent, puisque de nombreux particuliers et entreprises s’impliquent. 

En ce début de XXIe siècle marqué par les crises économiques et politiques, la philanthropie joue un rôle croissant pour répondre aux grands défis de notre temps. Alternative au modèle marchand et à la redistribution publique via l’impôt, le don privé est activement recherché pour financer la lutte contre la pauvreté, l’éducation, la recherche médicale ou la culture… Partout dans le monde, les fondations se multiplient, les dons se développent et influencent la vie de très nombreuses personnes. Les besoins sont immenses et la concurrence pour trouver des fonds n’a jamais été aussi vive. 

Malgré son importance, la philanthropie reste mal connue notamment en France et en Europe. Plusieurs questions clés restent en suspens : De quoi parle-t-on exactement ? Qu’est-ce qui motive les philanthropes et favorise leur action ? Quelles sont les différentes façons d’agir en philanthropie ? Quel est son impact et comment l’évaluer? L’objectif de ce MOOC est de répondre à ces quatre grandes questions, en mobilisant les dernières avancées en matière de recherche et le point de vue d’experts reconnus dans leur domaine. 

Que vous soyez simplement curieux de découvrir le sujet, déjà donateur ou engagé dans une démarche philanthropique, ou un professionnel qui accompagne ou sollicite des philanthropes, ce MOOC est fait pour vous ! Chaque semaine, vous progresserez grâce à des vidéos alliant théorie et pratique, des lectures pour aller plus loin, des quiz pour renforcer vos acquis et des forums où vous pourrez échanger entre participants et avec l’équipe pédagogique. A l’issue de ce MOOC, vous aurez toutes les clés en main pour comprendre et agir en faveur d’un monde meilleur !

Ce MOOC est réalisé par la chaire Philanthropie de l’ESSEC, en collaboration avec la Fondation de France. 

La chaire Philanthropie de l’ESSEC bénéficie du soutien de la Fondation de France, de la Fondation Daniel & Nina Carasso, des Fondations Edmond de Rothschild, de la Fondation Bettencourt Schueller et de la Fondation Caritas France."

If you are aiming to rise up in the ranks in your health system or looking to pivot your career in the direction of big data and health IT, this course is made for you. You'll hear from experts at Johns Hopkins about their experiences harnessing the power of big data in healthcare, improving EHR adoption, and separating out the hope vs hype when it comes to digital medicine. 

Whether you're a nurse, pharmacist, physician, other allied health professional or come from a non-clinical background--you know that Health Informatics skills are in demand. This newly launched 5-course specialization by JohnsHopkins faculty members provides a solid foundation for anyone wanting to become a leader in  one of the hottest fields in healthcare. 

As health informaticians, we need to be very clear in our understanding of the current state (as-is), the future state (to-be) and any unintended consequences that can result from our interventions. Prior to introducing large scale change, we need to assess whether a healthcare organization is truly ready for change. This involves taking into account an organization's current culture and values. Successfully leading change through health informatics also requires strategic planning and careful financial considerations. Proper workflow redesign and a clear change management strategy are of utmost importance when introducing new technologies and in ensuring their successful adoption and proper use. 

By the end of this course, students will become familiar with examples of successful and failed attempts at change in health informatics, and the reasons for each. Students will be armed with tools to help optimize their chances for successfully leading change in their respective organizations. "

Pero esa riqueza de información no siempre se traduce en mejores decisiones. Saber cómo interpretar los datos es el desafío, y se espera que los mercadólogos en particular usen cada vez más la analítica para informar y justificar sus decisiones. 

El mercadeo analítico permite que los mercadólogos midan, gestionen y analicen el rendimiento de las actividades de mercadeo para maximizar su eficacia y optimizar el retorno de la inversión (Return On Investment, ROI). Más allá de las aplicaciones obvias de ventas y generación de clientes potenciales, el mercadeo analítico puede ofrecer conocimientos profundos de preferencias y tendencias de los clientes, lo cual se puede utilizar para futuras decisiones de mercadeo y de negocios.

Este curso, desarrollado en Darden School of Business de la Universidad de Virginia, le da las herramientas para medir los activos de la marca y del cliente, comprender el análisis de regresión y diseñar experimentos como una forma de evaluar y optimizar campañas de mercadeo. Terminará el curso con una sólida comprensión de cómo utilizar el mercadeo analítico para predecir resultados y asignar recursos sistemáticamente.

Hasta el momento, el desarrollo económico ha estado basado en un crecimiento continuo basado en el uso de recursos naturales sin tener en cuenta las consecuencias derivadas de su uso ineficientes, y los impactos ambientales que generan en el medio ambiente.
Frente a esta situación, desde hace unos años se ha intensificado el debate sobre cómo debería ser la economía para permitir un desarrollo más sustentable. Uno de los conceptos que ha ganado fuerza es el de la Economía Circular, que sirviéndose de la investigación desarrollada desde finales de 1970’s se inspira para plantear productos, y sistemas industriales y urbanos más respetuosos con el medio ambiente. La economía circular, pues, no es un concepto del todo nuevo. Representa una nueva forma de entender y analizar sistemas actuales, y de promover sistemas y productos más respetuosos con el medio ambiente.
En este curso aprenderás lo fundamentos de la economía circular, las cifras actuales que demuestran la necesidad de avanzar hacia sistemas y productos circulares, y sobre todo las herramientas básicas para poder analizar los sistemas socioeconómicos actuales.
La estructura del curso contempla 5 sesiones, cada uno requiere una dedicación de unas 4 horas de estudio y práctica. La primera sesión explica las distintas escuelas de pensamiento que han servido para desarrollar el concepto de la Economía Circular. Durant la segunda sesión, os mostraré cuales son los compromisos políticos y los planes de acción en EC en Europa que se están implementando para mejorar ambientalmente la economía actual. Las tres sesiones siguientes describen los fundamentos básicos para analizar un sistema y producto desde un punto de vista físico. Después de hacer una introducción sobre los principios de termodinámica, y de conservación de la materia, aprenderás como se usan para el análisis de sistemas. También hablaremos sobre el ecodiseño o diseño para el medio ambiente, y finalmente de cómo algunas de estas herramientas se aplican conjuntamente.
El curso está orientado a profesionales en medio ambiente y gestión de empresas, también universitarios de pregrado y estudiantes de posgrado y tecnólogos."

In this project, you will learn the high level theory and intuition behind the four main causal inference techniques of controlled regression, regression discontinuity, difference in difference, and instrumental variables as well as some techniques at the intersection of machine learning and causal inference that are useful in data science called double selection and causal forests. These will help you rigorously answer questions like those above and become a better data scientist!"
1356,KDpdcxuGEea2Gw5ROLcooQ,Concurrent Programming in Java,concurrent-programming-in-java,"This course teaches learners (industry professionals and students) the fundamental concepts of concurrent programming in the context of Java 8.   Concurrent programming enables developers to efficiently and correctly mediate the use of shared resources in parallel programs.  By the end of this course, you will learn how to use basic concurrency constructs in Java such as threads, locks, critical sections, atomic variables, isolation, actors, optimistic concurrency and concurrent collections, as well as their theoretical foundations (e.g., progress guarantees, deadlock, livelock, starvation, linearizability).

Why take this course?

•	It is important for you to be aware of the theoretical foundations of concurrency to avoid common but subtle programming errors. 
•	Java 8 has modernized many of the concurrency constructs since the early days of threads and locks.
•	During the course, you will have online access to the instructor and mentors to get individualized answers to your questions posted on the forums.
•	Each of the four modules in the course includes an assigned mini-project that will provide you with the necessary hands-on experience to use the concepts learned in the course on your own, after the course ends.

The desired learning outcomes of this course are as follows:

•	Concurrency theory: progress guarantees, deadlock, livelock, starvation, linearizability
•	Use of threads and structured/unstructured locks in Java
•	Atomic variables and isolation
•	Optimistic concurrency and concurrent collections in Java (e.g., concurrent queues, concurrent  hashmaps)
•	Actor model in Java

Mastery of these concepts will enable you to immediately apply them in the context of concurrent Java programs, and will also help you master other concurrent programming system that you may encounter in the future  (e.g., POSIX threads, .NET threads)."

Through this course, I hope that you will come to appreciate that war is both a natural expression of common human emotions and interactions and a constitutive part of how we cohere as groups. That is, war is paradoxically an expression of our basest animal nature and the exemplar of our most vaunted and valued civilized virtues. You will learn some basic military history and sociology in this course as a lens for the more important purpose of seeing the broader social themes and issues related to war. I want you to both learn about war, but more importantly, use it as way of understanding your everyday social world. So, for example, the discussion of war and gender will serve to start you thinking about how expectations of masculinity are created and our discussion of nationalism will make clear how easy “us-them” dichotomies can be established and (ab)used. I will suggest some readings for you to complement the class and assign some activities through which you will be able to apply the theoretical insights from the course to your observations of everyday life. At the end of the course, you will start to see war everywhere and come to appreciate how much it defines our life.

This project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Coordination Research and Innovation Action under Grant Agreement No. 826497.

The course ""Cybersecurity in Healthcare"" has been developed to raise awareness and understanding the role of cybersecurity in healthcare (e.g., hospitals, care centres, clinics, other medical or social care institutions and service organisations) and the challenges that surround it. In this course, we will cover both theoretical and practical aspects of cybersecurity. We look at both social aspects as technical aspects that come into play. Furthermore, we offer helpful resources that cover different aspects of cybersecurity. Even if you are not active in the healthcare domain, you will find helpful tips and insights to deal with cybersecurity challenges within any other organisation or in personal contexts as well.

This course begins by introducing the opportunities and challenges that digitalisation of healthcare services has created. It explains how the rise of technologies and proliferation of (medical) data has become an attractive target to cybercriminals, which is essential in understanding  why  adequate cybersecurity measures are critical within the healthcare environment. In later modules, course contents cover the threats, both inside and outside of healthcare organisations like e.g. social engineering and hacking. Module 4 on Cyber Hygiene describes how to improve cybersecurity within healthcare organisations in practical ways.  Module 5 looks deeper into how organisational culture affects cybersecurity, the cybersecurity culture, focusing on the interaction between human behaviour and technology and how organisational factors can boost or diminish the level and attention to cybersecurity in healthcare.

Do you work for a hospital, clinic, medical practice, care centre, care provider, social care organisation, or nursing home? Do you want to improve your personal or your organisation’s cybersecurity (cyber security, IT security, information security, network security, computer security, awareness)?

　　與莊子為友，在李白之後、東坡之後，在詩人、哲人、職人與成千上萬因此改變姿勢、意識與用情的人們之後，本季課程將陪你逐字逐句讀完莊子親筆內七篇中的前三篇〈逍遙遊〉、〈齊物論〉、〈養生主〉，而莊周在此中斷續鋪陳、輻輳的三個主題：姿勢、意識與感情，也將在逐字逐句的講解中豁然胸次。──你會發現，原來只要把注意力收回自身，心就可以不煩、不亂、不痛。原來只要掌握正確的姿勢原則，身體竟可以如此輕靈放鬆。原來感情可以不執著、不陷溺，只要懂得深情而不滯於情。原來身心的安定，是面對混亂的時代最有力量的武器。

　　時局板蕩，曖昧天光，半部《論語》治天下，半部《莊子》治身心，正是時候，好好讀《莊子》。

　　為使聽者易於掌握《莊》學大旨，將〈逍遙遊〉、〈齊物論〉、〈養生主〉各分為三、五、五章，各章下依長度略分小節；並設計體驗古典單元，使能活用於日常。"

Learners investigate how such an economy cannot sustain itself and the need for a rapid transition to something different. We define sustainability, the meaning of sustainable development, and the United Nations' Sustainability Goals. 
 
Recognizing that change is imperative, we begin looking at energy, and more specifically, power generation as this is widely understood as the leading cause of climate change today. We show why this is the case and explore pathways to reduce carbon emissions, such as through the transition from coal and natural gas to renewables such as wind and solar. The concept of the carbon footprint and how it is determined is introduced. Learners have the opportunity to calculate their own personal carbon footprint under a variety of power source options (coal, natural gas, or renewable), and discover what would happen to their personal carbon footprint if they moved toward renewable energies."

1425,PJg2NGKXEeWpHwqwM9Gg0w,The Rooseveltian Century,roosevelt,"This course uses the lives, ideals and achievements of Theodore, Franklin, and Eleanor Roosevelt to create the idea of a Rooseveltian century. It is about doing research, analyzing primary sources, and connecting all this information with a coherent and logical interpretation. It is an invitation to think critically and historically, and it wants to give you a glimpse of what it means to be a historian at work. 

We are convinced that the three Roosevelts – the 3Rs, as we will refer to them throughout this course – profoundly shaped the twentieth century. This course shows you why we think so and which paradigms, ideas, and sources we use to uphold our claim. But this course also asks you to give your opinion, and ground it on your own research findings. 

The structure of the course is straightforward: 
- An introductory module gives you the biographical information you need to connect the personal stories of the 3Rs with the major events of the twentieth century;
-  Module 2 explains how the 3Rs reframed our thinking on security, broadening its meaning and reconfiguring the government’s role in providing it; 
- Module 3, focusing on equality, shows how the 3Rs changed the relationship between leaders and led, rejected laissez-faire economics, and supported a politics of intervention to overcome the inequalities that undermined social cohesion;
- Module 4 describes how the 3Rs promoted and protected the freedom of ordinary citizens, and communicated that as one of their central political goals;
- Module 5 summarizes the long-lasting legacies of the 3Rs, and asks for your opinion on the Rooseveltian century. Do you agree with this interpretation of our recent past – and our possible futures?

The five modules contain quizzes to test your knowledge and understanding, discussion prompts to stimulate your creativity, and research guidance and assignments to sharpen up your historical skills. 

We hope you will enjoy this intellectual journey!"

Ce cours présente les principaux courants qui marquent aujourd'hui la réflexion éthique et touchent tout un chacun dans sa vie personnelle, sociale et citoyenne. D’Aristote à Kant, de Bentham à Derrida, à travers un voyage philosophique passionnant nous entrerons dans le vif du débat éthique contemporain.

Notre monde toujours plus complexe semble nous échapper. Réchauffement climatique, questions de début et de fin de vie, évolution vertigineuse des bio-technologies, inégale distribution des richesses, pressions migratoires accentuées… La tentation est grande d’une vie morale repliée sur elle-même à partir d’une éthique minimale : « fais ce que tu veux, du moment que tu ne mets pas en péril la liberté des autres ». Nous proposons de prendre le contre-pied : défendre l’idée d’une éthique qui nous plonge dans notre réalité sociale et politique, parmi nos semblables et avec eux. Et pour cela nous reposons la question de ce qui est juste, de ce qui est bien. Sans repartir de rien, sans tout réinventer.
C’est pourquoi nous présentons un cours qui permet de se familiariser avec les plus importantes perspectives éthiques traversant le monde contemporain : l’éthique des vertus (ou perfectionnisme) ; l’éthique du devoir (ou déontologisme) ; l’éthique utilitariste (ou conséquentialisme) ; l’éthique de l’amour (ou éthique du don). Ainsi chacun pourra mettre de l’ordre dans ses idées, repérer les différentes manières de s’orienter dans la vie morale, comprendre les différences d’appréciation face aux diverses situations qui interpellent et sollicitent.

Quels que soient votre champ de savoir académique, votre engagement professionnel ou vos choix personnels, il s’agit de proposer des clés d’analyse dont vous disposerez. Pour cela, nous alternerons tout au long de ce cours les présentations des grands courants, sous leur forme ancienne puis contemporaine, et des questions plus transversales ou des cas concrets. Avec un seul but : clarifier les idées pour mieux comprendre le réel et mieux orienter l’action.

About this course:

This course presents the main schools of thought that frame today’s ethical reflection and affect everyone in their personal, social and civic life. From Aristotle to Kant, from Bentham to Derrida, we will take you to the heart of contemporary ethical debates through a fascinating philosophical journey. Our increasingly complex world seems to elude our grasp. Global warming, beginning and end-of-life issues, the dizzying evolution of bio-technologies, the unequal distribution of wealth, heightened migratory pressures ... In response, we are tempted to make the moral life a self-legislating and isolated affair: ""do what you want, as long as you do not put at risk the freedom of others"". We propose to go against this trend and to defend the idea of ​​an ethics that immerses us in our social and political reality, in and amongst our peers. We thus reformulate the question of what is right and what is good. This is not to say we are starting from scratch and reinventing the wheel. Rather, we will offer a course that allows you to encounter the most important ethical perspectives of our contemporary world: virtue ethics (or perfectionism); ethics of duty (or deontology); utilitarianism (or consequentialism); ethics of love (or ethics of the gift). Everyone will thus have a chance to evaluate his or her ideas, to identify different approaches to the moral life, and to understand a range of perspectives on different situations that face us in our lives. Whatever your field of academic knowledge, your professional commitments or personal choices, this course presents key concepts for further analysis. Therefore, we will alternate discussions of the founding schools of ethical thought, in their ancient and contemporary formulations, with cross-disciplinary issues and applied case studies. The goal throughout is to clarify ideas in order to better understand reality and orient human action.

In this course:

1. Build the simplest form of agentic RAG – a router. Given a query, the router will pick one of two query engines, Q&A or summarization, to execute a query over a single document.

2. Add tool calling to your router agent where you will use an LLM to not only pick a function to execute but also infer an argument to pass to the function.

3. Build a research assistant agent. Instead of tool calling in a single-shot setting, an agent is able to reason over tools in multiple steps. 

4. Build a multi-document agent where you will learn how to extend the research agent to handle multiple documents.

Unlike the standard RAG pipeline—suitable for simple queries across a few documents—this intelligent approach adapts based on initial findings to enhance further data retrieval. You’ll learn to develop an autonomous research agent, enhancing your ability to engage with and analyze your data comprehensively.

You’ll practice building agents capable of intelligently navigating, summarizing, and comparing information across multiple research papers from arXiv. Additionally, you’ll learn how to debug these agents, ensuring you can guide their actions effectively.

1543,BGJTmeEGEe6mBAr_6B02pw,Cutting-edge Technology in Air Conditioning System,cutting-edge-technology-in-air-conditioning-system,"In the dynamic field of HVAC technology, strategies like Demand Control Ventilation (DCV) are revolutionizing indoor air quality and energy efficiency. DCV dynamically adjusts ventilation rates based on real-time occupancy and air quality indicators, optimizing conditions for occupants while minimizing energy consumption. Adherence to codes and standards, notably ASHRAE Standard 62.1, ensures the safety and efficiency of DCV systems.

A key focus of DCV is monitoring and controlling carbon dioxide (CO2) levels, a crucial indicator of indoor air quality. Elevated CO2 levels prompt real-time adjustments in ventilation rates, preventing the accumulation of pollutants and promoting a constant supply of fresh air. This adaptive approach aligns with principles promoting occupant health and well-being.

Designing ventilation rates within DCV involves considering factors such as occupancy, space size, and specific application requirements. Strategies like damper control and precise positioning efficiently meet ventilation demands. DCV's versatility extends to both Constant Air Volume (CAV) and Variable Air Volume (VAV) systems.

In Constant Air Volume (CAV) systems, DCV optimizes airflow by modulating it based on real-time occupancy and air quality data. This ensures ventilation precisely tailored to the immediate needs of the space, balancing energy efficiency and air quality maintenance. In Variable Air Volume (VAV) systems, DCV adjusts the air supply to match demand, optimizing energy conservation without compromising air quality. An example illustrates the seamless integration of DCV within a VAV system, showcasing practical impact.

CO2 sensors, including advanced types like nondispersive infrared (NDIR) sensors, play a pivotal role in DCV systems. Proper sensor placement ensures accurate readings, enhancing overall effectiveness by providing precise data on indoor air quality.

Shifting to the broader context of HVAC, understanding fans, their history, and diverse applications is essential. Fans, integral to industrial processes and electronics cooling, have evolved with various types, including centrifugal and axial fans. Appreciating fan terminologies like pressure, flow rate, speed, and efficiency becomes vital.

Centrifugal fans excel in scenarios requiring directed and pressurized airflow, while axial fans are ideal for linear airflow applications. Grasping fan terminologies is crucial for optimizing performance. The affinity laws and fan control strategies govern efficiency, providing insights into operational optimization. Fan performance curves visually depict relationships between airflow, pressure, and power consumption, aiding in selecting and optimizing fan systems.

Expanding the horizon, Variable Refrigerant Flow (VRF) systems mark a milestone in HVAC technology. Evolving from traditional systems, VRF systems offer a dynamic and energy-efficient approach. Continuous advancements introduce features like individual zone control, energy efficiency, and adaptability to variable loads.

The escalating demand for energy-efficient HVAC solutions underscores the need for VRF systems. Their capacity for simultaneous heating and cooling, coupled with precise temperature control, makes them preferred in various applications. Designing VRF systems involves meticulous consideration of factors like building size, occupancy, and specific requirements for each zone. The connectivity or combination ratio, indicating the number of indoor units connected to a single outdoor unit, significantly influences system efficiency.

In conclusion, from Demand Control Ventilation to advanced fan systems and Variable Refrigerant Flow, these strategies form a comprehensive picture of HVAC technology. Rooted in energy efficiency and sustainability, they play a pivotal role in shaping the future of indoor environmental control, catering to occupant comfort, operational efficiency, and environmental responsibility.

Because we’re usually in a rush, we don’t have the luxury of finding out all the information that we would like to. But no matter the situation, our understanding of the human story will determine a great deal about our communication.

Research shows that when we hear a story, our brain begins to sync with the storyteller. We quickly make connections drawn from our own lives and can fill in other aspects in a story like meaning, emotion, narrative trajectory and so on.

As the listener, it’s relatively easy to hear a story and imagine, empathize and even come up with possible solutions to alleviate pain. But not so easy when you are the provider—and part of the story itself. Why is that? Why can we do it from a distance, but it’s so difficult to see when we are one of the people in the story? This course discusses these questions.

1591,KK4EhXQMEeSc3CIACrbZqg,Financing and Investing in Infrastructure,infrastructure-investing,"Learn how debt and equity can be used to finance infrastructure investments and how investors approach infrastructure investments! 

According to the OECD, the global infrastructure investment requirement by 2030 for transport, electricity generation, transmission & distribution, and water & telecommunications totals to 71 trillion dollars. This figure represents about 3.5% of the annual World GDP from 2007 to 2030.

The European Commission estimated, that by 2020, Europe will need between 1.5 - 2 trillion Euros in infrastructure investments. Between 2011 and 2020, about 500 billion Euros will be required for the implementation of the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T) program, 400 billion Euros for Energy distribution networks and smart grids, 200 billion Euros on Energy transmission networks and storage, and 500 billion Euros for the upgrade and construction of new power plants. An additional 38 - 58 billion Euros and 181 - 268 billion Euros in capital investment will be needed to achieve the targets set by the European Commission for broadband diffusion.

Traditionally investments in infrastructure were financed using public sources. However, severe budget constraints and inefficient management of infrastructure by public entities have led to an increased involvement of private investors in the business. 

The course focuses on how private investors approach infrastructure projects from the standpoint of equity, debt, and hybrid instruments. 

The course concentrates on the practical aspects of project finance: the most frequently used financial techniques for infrastructure investments. The repeated use of real life examples and case studies will allow students to link the theoretical background to actual business practices.

In the end of the course, students will be capable of analyzing a complex transaction, identifying the key elements of a deal, and suggesting proper solutions for deal structuring from a financial advisor's perspective.

Course Format
The course will consist of lecture videos, readings, and talks given by guest speakers. Although we do hope you will attend the entire course, it is possible to just focus on single topics.

Suggested Readings
The course is designed to be self-contained, there are no obligatory readings that must be acquired outside of the course.

머신 러닝(일명 '예측 분석')을 배포하기 위해서는, 그 작동 원리를 알아야 합니다. 자신이 실무자가 아닌 기업가라 해도(직접 수치를 다루지 않는 경우), 전반적인 프로젝트를 처리하기 위해서는 머신 러닝의 기본 메커니즘을 파악하고 있어야 합니다. 다시 말해 경영진, 의사결정권자, 또는 운영 관리자 등 직무와 관계없이 예측 모델을 통합하여 의사 결정을 내리는 방법을 감독하는 사람이라면, 가지고 있는 정보가 많을수록 더 나은 결과를 얻을 수 있습니다.

작동 원리를 자세히 살펴보는 일은 아주 재미있을 겁니다. 머신 러닝의 메커니즘은 흥미롭고 놀라울 뿐 아니라, 직관적으로도 이해가 쉽습니다. 전 세계적으로 머신 러닝의 영향력이 빠르게 커지고 있습니다. 이제는 데이터 예측력을 입증하고, 이를 과학적으로 활용하는 방법을 명확히 해야 할 때입니다.

본 강좌는 머신 러닝의 작동 원리를 다루고 있습니다. 복잡한 계산 없이 기초적인 원리, 데이터에서 통찰력을 얻는 방법, 이러한 통찰력을 신뢰할 수 있는 방법, 예측 모델의 성능은 어느 정도인지 등을 살펴봅니다. 이는 분석 전문가들 뿐 아니라 모든 비즈니스 전문가에게도 필요한 내용입니다.

또한 본 강좌에서는 일반적인 수준의 머신 러닝과 더불어 최신 고급 기법을 다룰 뿐 아니라, 굉장히 흔하지만 간과하기 쉬운 함정을 피할 수 있는 방법을 제시합니다. 본 강좌에서는 이러한 주제를 심층적으로 다루고 있지만, 기술적인 지식이 없는 학습자와 입문자도 쉽게 이해할 수 있도록 구성되었습니다.

본 강좌에서는 다음과 같이 성능이 우수하거나 그렇지 않은 기법, 그리고 그 경계에 있는 기법 등을 다루고 있으며, 이를 통해 어떤 기법이 효과적인지를 학습합니다.

– 의사결정 나무, 로지스틱 회귀, 신경망 등 예측 모델링 알고리즘의 작동 원리

– 과적합, p-해킹, 상관관계로부터 인과관계를 추정하는 오류 등의 위험한 함정

– 예측 모델을 해석하는 방법과 그 작동 원리를 설명하는 방법

– 앙상블 모델링, 업리프트 모델링(일명 ‘설득 모델링’) 등의 고급 기법

– 수많은 머신 러닝 소프트웨어 옵션 중 툴을 선정하는 방법

– 비즈니스 측면에서의 예측 모델 평가 방법

– 보호 계층에 대한 잠재적 편향이 내재된 예측 모델을 가려내는 방법 (AI 윤리)

Terrorism has arguably been one of the defining factors of our age. It frequently makes headlines, threatening or attacking governments, private businesses, and ordinary citizens. In many parts of the world, it has been one of the most important threats to peace, security, and stability – but what does this mean exactly? 

On this six-week course from Leiden University, you’ll explore the essence of terrorism and discover why it is so difficult to define. Unpacking its history and the theory of the waves of terrorism, you’ll analyse both the theoretical approaches and practical applications of terrorism and counterterrorism in the real world.

There are many assumptions that cloud the subjects of terrorism and counterterrorism. These myths are often created and intensified by individual bias, the government, and the media. On this course, you’ll discover different assumptions about terrorist identities and motivations, as well as the efficiencies of various counterterrorism efforts. You’ll then compare this with academic research to investigate the truth behind these assumptions.

In your exploration of the impact of terrorism, you’ll delve into the culture of fear created by terrorism, as well as the success of counterterrorism policies to limit and manage its impact on society.  In the final stage of this course, you’ll reflect on trends and developments in terrorism and counterterrorism.

Week 1: The first week starts with understanding the value of programs in the delivery of charters’ strategic outcomes from individual projects with excellence. A case example, coupled with a focus on the role of the conductor, will be used in learning how to drive and tailor the delivery of programs to achieve speed and quality of decisions and simulate complexity for better quality customer-centered solutions and outputs.

Week 2: The second week explores the future changemakers and how world organizations use change management in achieving strategic results from related projects, and how change management and excellence models cover the gaps leaders miss when they tackle change programs such as digital transformation or new product introductions. The week also covers insights shared in PMWJ publication on the value of integrated decision-making and a model of digital transformation that combines culture, systems, and people attributes.

Week 3: The third week gets into the importance of the role of the program sponsor as the driver for the big picture and the clear mission of the PMO. Program management needs will be best uncovered with the application of tiers of stakeholders in organizing a program’s focus. Connected program goals, project interdependencies, and the developed mindset and discipline needed for program leaders to think again for a change, will directly link to achieving business objectives.

Week 4: The last week pivots to look at how getting to an end-2-end joint vision and clear strategic goals can inspire focus and commitment to the strategic plan and achieving program value. The program management office builds on the principles and methodologies of the project management institute. Successful programs will rely not only on effective cost management but also on how empathy and human connection are critical ingredients to the integrated program way of working, and the course finishes with tips for context validation’s role in programs success."

1806,C13J39SIEe2HUgoXSm74nw,Strategic Management for Churches,strategy-management-church-theology,"Why is vision theologically important for your church, and how should it be realized? How do church goals, objectives, metrics, core values, and culture play a crucial role in this? What kind of pastoral leadership is needed to bring God’s vision for your church to fruition? 
 
In this second course in the Duke Divinity+ Church Administration Specialization series, you will learn how to approach strategic management theologically as strategic stewardship for your church. Secular organizations widely use strategic management (including strategic planning) to define their future strategic direction and how to achieve it. In contrast, what we’re calling strategic stewardship for churches seeks to reappropriate strategic management by discerning God’s direction for the church and pursuing God-centered ways of realizing it.
 
This course will focus on select key elements of strategic management: vision (Week 1), core values and culture (Week 2), goals and objectives (Week 3), and metrics (Week 4). We will first explore how each key element functions as a useful management tool. Then, we will reappropriate the key element for theological ends of our church stewardship to God; hence, our terminology of strategic stewardship. Moreover, we will unpack what pastoral leadership for strategic stewardship should entail. Lastly, we will provide exemplar stories from Duke Divinity School alums, who will share how they each approached and implemented a key element in their church setting.

If you are a pastor or ministry professional in need of Continuing Education Unit (CEU) credits for your professional development, CEU credits are available for this course.  Please share your Coursera course certificate and a copy of the course description with your church denomination or employer as recognition of your earned 1.5 CEUs.

Prioridades de la Alta Dirección,alta-direccion,"Este curso persigue adentrarse en la realidad del trabajo de un alto ejecutivo: lo qué hace y cómo lo hace. Es un hecho conocido que la mayoría de altos directivos dedican hasta el 90% de su tiempo al día a día y menos del 10% a las tareas asociadas al pensamiento estratégico en la organización. Por eso es importante ir más allá y entender las prioridades que configuran esta actuación diaria. Al final, la mejor estrategia es aquella que se practica; la mejor organización, aquella que funciona; y el quehacer cotidiano coherente con las prioridades establecidas, la base de la continuidad con éxito de las empresas. 

El objetivo del curso es aportar una visión estructurada de cómo logran este objetivo los “buenos directivos”, con la voluntad de que sirva a futuros altos ejecutivos a orientar mejor su carrera, a enfocar sus actividades y a desarrollar su propio estilo de dirección.

El curso profundiza en las prioridades de la Alta Dirección a partir de la actuación diaria de directivos de probada valía y con éxito profesional en empresas diversas. 

El contenido está basado en los resultados de las entrevistas personales que hemos realizado a más de 200 directores generales de compañías muy diversas. Gran parte de este material ha quedado recogido en los libros publicados “Qué hacen los buenos directivos. El reto del siglo XXI”  y “Yo Dirijo”, cuya lectura recomendamos a todo aquel que desee ampliar su perspectiva sobre esta materia.

El modelo que se propugna en curso es el resultado de una amplia investigación empírica; no es una doctrina, sino un instrumento mental para ayudar a construir una configuración empresarial que potencie el hacer de la gente para que, sin dejación de su derecho a ser felices y a la autonomía, logren su plenitud como personas y como profesionales, a la vez que la compañía alcanza cotas altas en los indicadores de salud empresarial."

•	Define the problem clearly; articulate “what does success look like?”
•	Break the problem into “buckets” so it is easy to understand

Welcome to Course Four. As we know, most attacks against systems involve exploiting vulnerabilities in software that powers hardware. Additionally, attackers may exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying hardware, especially when that hardware is for the protected against being stolen or accessed with unauthorized use, but their real target and all the tax is data. Therefore, it's so critical, the total set of software powering an organization's business logic and processes must be kept secure. As we'll see in this chapter, the software provides a layered environment. Building from a core or kernel of trustworthy functions up through to the mobile code and executable content. This enables and empowers all web apps and remote data access. Security professionals need to appreciate securing software covers two very different, but closely related major tasks. They need to ensure that the Security Posture of that software is known and understood, as well as ensure the software is installed, maintained, and used in ways consistent with Security Posture or improve it over time. As we discussed in the previous chapter, Security Posture is the set of risks, vulnerabilities controls, and residual risks pertaining to an asset or system. We summarize the safety or risk of using an asset and the degree of reliance that can be placed on the results from a specific context or situation.  In this course, we'll build on that foundation by looking more closely at how the data can be the target of an attack and part of exploiting other vulnerabilities in the system. We'll explore what security professionals, as non-programmers, can do to reduce the risk of such malformed input attacks. In course two, we also discussed the non-human user concept as a general way to view management and security of devices and software entities to protect those entities from threats to their integrity and to protect the overall system and individual assets from unauthorized behavior by those non-human users. In this chapter, we'll build on those concepts, as we dive into Endpoint Security Issues and Approaches.

1865,hQk1JRlgEeuRtBLpTHsFtw,Activism in Sports and Culture  ,activism-sports-culture,"Sports have become an ever-present reflection of American culture, and an important symbol of the divisions and alliances in our society. Sports and political change walk hand in hand in America. The way that athletes and institutions deal with questions of race, economic hardship, nationalism, and political ties have become central to the way that we understand ourselves and our society. And yet, there are those who would prefer their sports free of controversy and opinion. Dedicated athletes, coaches, and media personalities have pushed back against this refrain, demanding to be seen not just as entertainers but as fully formed humans with political opinions and experiences. Their struggles against injustice have changed the face of America and kicked off a reckoning within modern-day sports. 

How does context inform the shape and outcome of protests? What is it about sports that provides space — or doesn't — for political statements? Why do some of us expect athletes to be activists, when others would rather they ""shut up and dribble""? We'll explore all of these questions and more in this class. 

Your professor will be NBA All-Star and TNT Sports journalist and commentator Chris Webber, who leads interviews with iconic activists, including John Carlos and Jemele Hill as they wrestle with the meanings and outcomes of their activism. You'll read and watch primary source documents about acts of protest, and academic and journalistic work that reckons with the legacies of those acts. By the end of the course, you'll have a better understanding of historical and contemporary protest moments, and be able to create and apply new ways of thinking about the activism within the world of sports in history and today."

More than 80% of matter in the Universe is mysterious Dark Matter, which made stars and galaxies to form. The newly discovered Higgs-boson became frozen into the Universe a trillionth of a second after the Big Bang and brought order to the Universe. Yet we still do not know how ordinary matter (atoms) survived against total annihilation by Anti-Matter. The expansion of the Universe started acceleration about 7 billion years ago and the Universe is being ripped apart. The culprit is Dark Energy, a mysterious energy multiplying in vacuum.

We use the idea of 'circles' to position the child at the center of the many levels of support needed. Around the child are circles of care and education - such as the parents, family, friends, caregivers, educators, health care workers, and others such as neighbors, business owners, and community members. Each one has an important role to play in the life of a person with an intellectual disability and can be seen as a caregiver and educator. Although this course is aimed particularly at caregivers who work at a  special centre or in a private home, each person in the circle of care and education plays a valuable role and will find the course useful.  

The course covers topics such as intellectual disability,  levels of severity of intellectual disability, and the history of intellectual disability. These inform how you can support children and youth with severe to profound intellectual disability so that they can reach their full potential and become participating members of society.  We look at lifelong learning by exploring brain development, the learning process, and how to maximise the opportunities for learning.

We ask experts about how best learning can be facilitated.  This includes looking at children’s learning support needs, how to go about planning activities for the learning programme, as well as how to empower multiple people who work in a team to care and educate children with severe to profound intellectual disability.

In the last week, we focus on rights, advocacy and relationships of care. Empowering and caring for caregivers themselves is a key focus of the course.

1930,AEpKK6nrEeyjPxJkzIUqCw,Maturing Risk Management,sscp-4th-ed-course-8,"Course 8: Maturing Risk Management

In management science terms, maturing a process or practice means taking positive steps over time to make it more reliable, repeatable and efficient. In practice, this means getting better every day, while showing the measurements that demonstrate improvement and suggest other opportunities to improve. As we saw in chapters one and two risk management for information intensive organizations works best when using evidence-based reasoning to identify, characterize, and take actions as necessary to resolve the issues. Course eight will bring together numerous threads that are intrinsically related to managing the risks associated with information systems. Also, we know that cyber attack is a risk for all organizations. In this course, we will focus on bringing these ideas together in a context of continuous maturity modeling, measuring and monitoring. Risk alignment works best at the strategic long-term level of planning. By contrast risk maturation can be most effective when considered in day-to-day business operations. This is sometimes called operationalizing one's approach to risk management and maturation. Operationalizing risk management asks us to take the life cycle models about systems, software and data and connect or pivot them around business operations. We'll take on the view of the workers who use the business logic and the systems or the people who oversee the robotics and internet of things on the factory or warehouse floor and see how each of the different security disciplines brings something to them. This course has five modules. Module one focuses on change management and reveals how this detailed administratively intense process plays a primary role in protecting information systems. We'll also look at its vital contributions to incident response and remediation. Module two shows how physical security design principles are used to monitor and control the flow of physical objects in and out of various security zones. This module also considers the operational effects of safety planning and preparation on people and property, as well as availability and integrity of systems and information. Module three provides a different attitude and mindset about empowering and enabling the people in the organization to become more effective contributors and proponents of its information security. Security training programs have failed to help people complete their job safely and securely. New concepts such as micro chaining demonstrates that security education and awareness can add value to the security process. Module four shows us that system security assessment should be an ongoing task. Security has always involved continuous vigilance and integrity. Formal and informal audits demonstrate just how effective an organization's security controls are. As its process of maturing those controls continues to improve their performance. Module five brings many of these ideas and concepts together through business continuity and disaster recovery planning. The emphasis will be the operational support of these tasks, both in the planning and execution stages. We've prepared the foundations so you can bring concepts covered thus far into a cohesive daily operational context.

2000,alJRh0cPEeaeRgqQhMBV5Q,Valuation for Startups Using Discounted Cash Flows Approach,discounted-cash-flow,"Discounted cash flow method means that we can find firm value by discounting future cash flows of a firm. That is, firm value is present value of cash flows a firm generates in the future. In order to understand the meaning of present value, we are going to discuss time value of money, first. That is, the value of $100 today is different from the value of $100 a year later. Then, what should be the present value of $100 that you are going to receive in 1 year? How about the value of $100 dollars that you are going to receive every year for next 10 years? How about forever? After taking this course, you are going to be able to find the present value of these types of cash flows in the future. Unlike most of finance courses, in this course, you are going to learn how to use excel to find present value of future cash flows. In addition to the present value, you are also going to learn how to find future value given investment; interest rate given investment and future cash flows, payments given interest rates, number of periods to wait given investment and interest rate, and so on. After learning the concept and how to find the time value of money, you are going to apply this to real world examples and company valuation. After taking this course, you will be ready to make an estimate of firm value by discounting its cash flows in the future."

2002,Ze5sb0GVEe2ZPw6AhFlMMQ,Designing Hardware for Raspberry Pi Projects,designing-hardware-for-raspberry-pi-projects,"This is course 4 of this specialization (although it can be taken out of order) and focuses on applying experience and knowledge gained in the first three courses to build physical electronics hardware. Specifically, this course focuses on four areas: circuit simulation, schematic entry, PCB layout, and 3D CAD modeling. There are many excellent commercial applications available in these areas, however to give everyone access we'll be using all free and open-source software.

By the end of this course you should feel comfortable using free and open-source software to design your own printed circuit board and any bracketry or case to hold it, customized for your application.

Module 1 covers circuit simulation using several open-source projects and simulation methods for simulating transient response of circuits as well as frequency-domain response of filters. Additionally, we'll use open-source filter synthesis tools to help you quickly design and simulation filters.

Module 2 is all about creating professional looking electrical schematics. This is both an art and a skill and we'll cover the technical elements of using schematic entry software as well as broad concepts that are portable to any commercial application.

Module 3 takes our schematic and turns it into a physical PCB design. Understanding this process of how the schematic and the PCB layout work together is critical. We'll be demonstrating this with open-source software, but again, the concepts apply to any commercial software you may have access to.

Module 4 demonstrates the powerful idea of co-designing your electrical and mechanical systems together. We'll create a 3D model of our electrical PCB and bring it into 3D CAD software to design mechanical parts around it. Tying together these two applications opens another dimension in customizing your projects."

Watch Course Overview:  https://youtu.be/mUja4iwbrTE

Intellectual property rights (IPR) has a great impact on innovation development and society. In Science, Engineering, and Business, we seek to create wealth through innovation in products, designs, manufacturing processes, and business systems or models. However, innovation leaders often FAIL to benefit from their discoveries and inventions when they are unable to adequately protect those innovations. Learn the basics of copyright, copyright infringement, derivative works/parody and copyright related to software.

This course provides learners with an understanding of Copyright law and how it can be used to protect business innovation. The course focus is on protecting innovations with copyright as one of several tools that can be used by companies and individuals to protect creative innovations.  In additional to learning about how copyright works in theory, we will also discuss situations in which copyright might not be effective in protecting innovations, and will focus on the legal issues involved from a practical business perspective rather than from a purely legal viewpoint.  This course is one part of a four course series focusing on protection of business innovations using copyright, patent, trademark and strategy, and these four courses may be taken in any order that is most beneficial to students interested in learning about protecting innovation.

2046,VlVL7qXiEeScJCIACymM8Q,Applying to U.S. Universities,study-in-usa,"“It depends.”  That is what you’ll hear when asking about the U.S. university admission process.  With over 4,000 universities in the United States and no standard application system, the U.S. admission process can be confusing for everyone, but especially for students applying from other countries.

This course will help international students (non-U.S. citizens) and non-native English speakers navigate the U.S. university admission process by offering practical information about the documents and pieces that make up a U.S. university application.  More importantly, admission officers will discuss how they use those pieces to decide who is accepted and who is denied, so that you can understand the process beyond the pieces.

By the end of this course, you will understand application basics that include researching schools, creating a school list, and establishing an application plan.  This course will not answer all of your application questions, but it will teach you to ask the right questions of yourself and the universities.  Ultimately, you will have all the information you need to start your process the right way, putting you on the path to acceptance.

* Please note, while the English Language Programs are part of the University of Pennsylvania, this is not a course about applying to Penn.  Furthermore, this course is intended for international students educated in the national curriculum of their country.  While other students are welcome to enroll, the course is not intended for American students or students studying in an American, International Baccalaureate, or Advanced Placement curriculum.

Test Driven Development or TDD involves writing tests before the python application is implemented. Writing the test before implementing the code means the tests should fail when they are executed, which removes the likelihood of a test returning a false positive result. It also is another means of verifying the code specification, especially if the tests are written by a person or group outside of the core development team.
Finally, the tests may be executed every time a code modification occurs to keep the code base in check.

Even within a political community, there may be sharp disagreements about the role and purpose of government.  Some want an active, involved government, seeing legal and political institutions as the means to solve our most pressing problems, and to help bring about peace, equality, justice, happiness, and to protect individual liberty.  Others want a more minimal government, motivated, perhaps, by some of the disastrous political experiments of the 20th Century, and the thought that political power is often just a step away from tyranny.  In many cases, these disagreements arise out of deep philosophical disagreements. 

All political and legal institutions are built on foundational ideas.  In this course, we will explore those ideas, taking the political institutions and political systems around us not as fixed and unquestionable, but as things to evaluate and, if necessary, to change.  We will consider the ideas and arguments of some of the world’s most celebrated philosophers, including historical thinkers such as Plato, Hugo Grotius, David Hume, Thomas Jefferson, and James Madison, and more contemporary theorists such as Michelle Alexander, Kwame Anthony Appiah, Bryan Caplan, Angela Davis, Ronald Dworkin, Jon Elster, John Hart Ely, H.L.A. Hart, Michael Huemer, Andrew Rehfeld, and Jeremy Waldron.

The aim of the course is not to convince you of the correctness of any particular view or political position, but to provide you with a deeper and more philosophically-informed basis for your own views, and, perhaps, to help you better understand the views of those with whom you disagree."

Imagine you went to work every day to connect artists with audiences, vision with reality, and money with a mission. That is what managers in the arts do, they play an essential role in transforming the minds, lives, and communities through creative expression.
	
This course has been conceptualized to address the need of skills and techniques to help professionals and managers in running art and cultural institutions. 

Learning Objectives
There are three objectives to this course. First, we will approach the biggest issue cultural institutions face, the coexistence of managers and curators and giving evidence as to when, how, and why they can get along. Second, we will focus on some contemporary facets on what is means to manage a cultural institution and what cultural managers should expect and be able to face. And lastly, we will provide models and tools to design and implement appropriate courses of action to satisfy customers (visitors and audiences) and build an advantage over the competition.

Course Structure
The course is divided into six sections. Five sections are dedicated to specific aspects and themes of managing cultural institutions, while the sixth section is dedicated to individual interviews of prominent cultural institution managers on specific topics. The involvement of professionals and managers gives an incredible value to the learning experience of this course. 

Each module is paired with a quiz and discussion forums to reflect on the variety of the heritage management, its complexity, and the power of the network that we will build together during the course.
Successful completion of the quizzes is required for a course certificate as explained in the Grading Policy page.

If you love art and want to make an impact in this unique and fantastic sector, this course will support you in understanding the peculiarities of this sector and how to leverage on its tools to make a bigger impact.

Look forward to meeting you online!

2069,PI-xSbH_Ee2d3wo_DItpEw,Narrative Economics,narrative-economics,"Dear Potential Learner,
 
Please take some time to read through this note before deciding to enroll.
 
This course, Narrative Economics, is relatively short and proposes a simple concept: we need to incorporate the contagion of narratives into our economic theory. You can think of narratives as stories that shape public beliefs, which in turn influence our decision making. Understanding how people arrived at certain decisions in the past can aid our understanding of the economy today and improve our forecasts of the future.

Popular thinking heavily influences our answers to questions such as how much to invest, how much to spend or save, whether to go to college or take a certain job, and many more. Narrative economics is the study of the viral spread of popular narratives that affect economic behavior. I believe incorporating these ideas into our research must be done both to improve our ability to anticipate and prepare for economic events and help us structure economic institutions and policy. Until we better incorporate it into our methods of analysis and forecasting, we remain blind to a very real, very palpable, very important mechanism for economic change. Even in the dawning age of the Internet and artificial intelligence, so long as people remain ultimately in control, human narratives will matter. Maybe they will especially matter as the new technology exploits human weaknesses and creates new venues for narrative contagion. If we do not understand the epidemics of popular narratives, we cannot fully understand changes in the economy and in economic behavior.
 
 The course is broken into 4 modules:
 
Part I introduces basic concepts and demonstrates how popular stories change over time to affect economic outcomes, including recessions, depressions and inequality as well as effective inspiration and growth.. These stories can be observed from diverse sources such as politics, the media, or even popular songs.
 
Part II seeks to answer why some stories go viral, while others are quickly forgotten, by defining our narrative theory more firmly. This module enumerates and explores a list of seven propositions to help discipline any analysis of economic narratives.
 
Part III examines nine perennial narratives that have proved their ability to influence important economic decisions. They include narratives regarding artificial intelligence, stock market bubbles, and job insecurity.
 
Part IV looks to the future and highlights the opportunities for consilience in Narrative Economics. We share some thoughts about where narratives are taking us at this point in history and what kind of future research could improve our understanding of them.
 
This course offers only the beginnings of a new idea and a few suggestions for how it could be used by economists and financial professionals. The tone is not prescriptive or authoritative, as perhaps my Coursera course, Financial Markets, is in places. It represents the beginning of the journey (epidemic). This course is my way of floating the “germ” of this idea out into the broader community of not only professionals but of anyone who is interested in discovering how and why things become “important” to us as a society. I hope some of you will become infected by this idea, mutate it, spread it, and advance it. The beginning of the journey is the easy part. The challenge will come in taking these concepts to the next level. We have the tools to incorporate narratives into our research and the moral obligation to act; only the work remains.

2070,NjakpyWaEeWs4gorU6Q1Yw,Ideas from the History of Graphic Design,graphic-design-history,"This condensed survey course focuses on four key periods or themes from the history of design in the West. Together we’ll trace the emergence of design as a recognized practice, why things look the way they do, and how designers approached specific design problems in their work. 

Students will develop an understanding of where the wide variety of today’s design practice comes from. By participating in this survey of the works of innovative groups and individuals, we outline the process by which graphic design moved from a purely instrumental practice, to becoming a demanding creative and hybridized field.

Each week, a short quiz will test your knowledge of concepts, and a short reflective assignment will give you the opportunity to analyze the questions designers ask themselves today.

This is an essential course for emerging designers entering the field, or for students interested in learning more about visual culture and analysis. No previous experience is required.

A note about this course: 

This course is taught from the perspective of contemporary design, to connect ideas that helped formulate design practice from the 1850s through the 1960s to the ways that designers think today. The relationship of words and pictures in graphic design is looked at through the ever-changing social and cultural contexts, technologies, aesthetics, and politics of their eras. 

The definition and practice of graphic design includes all public visual communications, which is a global practice. It was the evolution of mass production and communication in the West that specifically redefined graphic design as a professional practice and is this course’s particular narrative. We hope students will consider how to connect the themes and ideas offered in this course to your own culture."

By the end, you'll have a solid understanding of the fundamentals of TypeScript and how to leverage it to create safer and more reliable JavaScript applications.

TypeScript is a ""superset"" of JavaScript, meaning all valid JavaScript code is also valid in TypeScript. However, TypeScript enhances your coding experience by enabling you to write code with greater confidence in the stability and longevity of your projects. This is done via compile-time checking, which identifies potential bugs before running the code, allowing you to fix issues proactively and prevent crashes in your programs. This ensures a smoother and more reliable development process (and less rage-quitting!)


By providing a strong typing system and modern tooling support, TypeScript also provides a robust development environment. This makes it easier to refactor code, manage large codebases, and collaborate with other developers. This introductory course will equip you with the knowledge and skills to effectively integrate TypeScript into your JavaScript projects.

2) THE ACCURACY FALLACY: When evaluating how well a model works, are you even reporting on the right thing?

3) P-HACKING: Are your simplest discoveries from data even real?

4) THE PARADOX OF ENSEMBLE MODELS: Do you understand how they work, even though they seem to defy Occam's Razor?

The impacts of climate change are already being felt around the world, affecting both natural and human systems, and these impacts are expected to become greater in years to come.

On this five-week course from the University of Edinburgh, you’ll gain the knowledge and tools you need to make a real difference and help tackle climate change, specifically focusing on the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

The science is now unequivocal that humans are the main driver of the changes we are seeing in our climate. This course will guide you through the basics of what global climate change is and the ways that we can address it. You’ll delve into the science, policy, and business contexts of climate change, from its history and how we study it to the carbon cycle and greenhouse gases.

As the global climate has been warming, this heat has not been equally distributed around the world. In fact, the UAE has warmed at almost twice the average global rate, now experiencing temperatures around 1.8 degrees Celsius warmer than prior to the industrial revolution. This level of change has had a drastic impact on the country.

You will discover how the country’s climate has changed over the years, what is expected to happen in the future, and how those further changes could continue to impact human health, agriculture, and the economy.

2110,LiOKcgInEeaC3QpVD3K7WQ,Strategy and Sustainability,strategy-sustainability,"Business and environmental sustainability are not natural bedfellows. Business is about making money. Sustainability is about protecting the planet. Business is measured in months and quarters. Sustainability often requires significant short term costs to secure a sometimes uncertain long-term benefit. To some activists, all executives are exploitative, selfish one percenters. To some executives, all activists are irresponsible, unyielding extremists. 

And yet engaging with the issue isn’t optional – all businesses must have a strategy to deal with sustainability and, like any strategy, this involves making choices. 

This Strategy and Sustainability course based on Rosenberg's recently published book by Palgrave (http://www.palgrave.com/la/book/9781137501738) that encourages learners to filter out the noise and make those choices in a hard-nosed and clear-eyed way. Prof. Rosenberg’s nuanced and fact-based point of view recognizes the complexity of the issues at hand and the strategic choices businesses must make. He blends the work of some of the leading academic thinkers in the field with practical examples from a variety of business sectors and geographies and offers a framework with which senior management might engage with the topic, not (just) to save the planet but to fulfill their short, medium and long-term responsibilities to shareholders and other stakeholders.

This course promises to be both engaging and thought-provoking, aimed at anyone who wishes to gain a deeper understanding of a subject that is no longer perceived as a choice but a necessity for future managers and business leaders alike."

Through our course we will explore an actionable model that defines product-market fit using five key components. From bottom to top, we will examine the layers of product-market fit beginning with your target customer and transitioning through your customer’s underserved needs, your value proposition, your feature set, and ultimately your user experience (UX).

Our process is an iterative, easy-to-follow guide through each layer to achieve product-market fit. This process helps you to articulate, test, and revise your key hypotheses about your product and the market so you can define and improve your product-market fit.

Using the principles of Lean Product Process, our course is structured in seven steps: determining your target customer, identifying underserved customer needs, defining your value proposition, specifying your minimum viable product (MVP) feature set, creating your MVP prototype, testing your MVP with customers, and iterating to improve product-market fit."

The more general purpose you are, the more flexible you are and the more kinds of programs and algorithms you can execute on your underlying computing infrastructure. All of this is terrific, but there is no free food and this is happening, quite often, by losing in efficiency.

This course will present several scenarios where the workloads require more performance than can be obtained even by using the fastest CPUs. This scenario is turning cloud and data center architectures toward accelerated computing. Within this course, we are going to show you how to gain benefits by using Xilinx SDAccel to program Amazon EC2 F1 instances. We are going to do this through a working example of an algorithm used in computational biology.

The huge amount of data the algorithms need to process and their complexity raised the problem of increasing the amount of computational power needed to perform the computation. In this scenario, hardware accelerators revealed to be effective in achieving a speed-up in the computation while, at the same time, saving power consumption. Among the algorithms used in computational biology, the Smith-Waterman algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm, guaranteed to find the optimal local alignment between two strings that could be nucleotides or proteins. In the following classes, we present an analysis and successive FPGA-based hardware acceleration of the Smith-Waterman algorithm used to perform pairwise alignment of DNA sequences.

Within this context, this course is focusing on distributed, heterogeneous cloud infrastructures, providing you details on how to use Xilinx SDAccel, through working examples, to bring your solutions to life by using the Amazon EC2 F1 instances."

This course begins a series of classes illustrating the power of computing in modern biology. Please join us on the frontier of bioinformatics to look for hidden messages in DNA without ever needing to put on a lab coat.

In the first half of the course, we investigate DNA replication, and ask the question, where in the genome does DNA replication begin?  We will see that we can answer this question for many bacteria using only some straightforward algorithms to look for hidden messages in the genome.

In the second half of the course, we examine a different biological question, when we ask which DNA patterns play the role of molecular clocks.  The cells in your body manage to maintain a circadian rhythm, but how is this achieved on the level of DNA?  Once again, we will see that by knowing which hidden messages to look for, we can start to understand the amazingly complex language of DNA.  Perhaps surprisingly, we will apply randomized algorithms, which roll dice and flip coins in order to solve problems.

Finally, you will get your hands dirty and apply existing software tools to find recurring biological motifs within genes that are responsible for helping Mycobacterium tuberculosis go ""dormant"" within a host for many years before causing an active infection."

The objective of this course is to get participants acquainted with multilevel models. These models are often used for the analysis of ‘hierarchical’ data, in which observations are nested within higher level units (e.g. repeated measures nested within individuals, or pupils nested within schools).  In this type of data causes of outcomes (e.g. the performance of pupils in schools) are located both at the level of the individual (e.g., own and parental resources), and at a higher, contextual, level shared by some of the individuals (e.g. characteristics of the class and of the teacher). Because of this, the assumption of 'independent observations' is violated with hierarchical data, but multilevel modelling can easily account for that. Moreover, multilevel modelling can easily deal with missing data (in most circumstances).

This huge family already known can cause cold or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and other severe diseases. The main signs and symptoms of the infected people include respiratory symptoms, fever, dry cough, shortness of breath, and dyspnea, etc. In severe and critical cases, there will appear pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure, and even death. The two-month war against COVID-19 has helped us accumulate loads of experience in disease prevention, control, diagnosis, and treatment, which can be shared with the whole world as a reference.
In front of the need of our students and common people on COVID-19 prevention knowledge, the Health Science Center of Xi’an Jiaotong University has organized related experts to issue the English lectures of the epidemic prevention and control for people at home and abroad and international community. The contents are mainly about “Introduction,Diagnose,therapeutic Strategy and Prevention for COVID-19”. Through this course, we sincerely hope all our students and the common peoples of the world have scientific knowledge of COVID-19 and increased self-protection awareness, improving international community’s capacity for the prevention and control of COVID-19. We should work in great unity, take science-based and targeted measures against the epidemic, and have confidence in conquering the virus."

2206,z7N7I4I-EemxHBIfhzoMNA,Simulation Skills: This is Your Brain on the Future,simulation-skills,"Do you want to learn how to simulate the future more creatively and more effectively? This course is for you.

Humans are the only living creatures with the ability to think about and make plans for the long- term future. Even so, our brains don’t always make it easy. Over the past decade, scientists have discovered a number of neurological “road blocks” to effective futures thinking. These glitches in the brain make it harder for us to accurately predict how we’ll feel and what we’re likely to do, when a particular future arrives. They lead us to make faulty assumptions about which futures are likely or unlikely to happen. And they convince us we have less power to shape and influence the future than we actually do – leaving us stuck in the present. 

In this course, you’ll learn how to overcome these obstacles so you can think about the future more strategically and creatively. You’ll practice simulation techniques for “unsticking” the mind when it comes to seeing what’s possible in the future and accepting how things could be different. You’ll also learn how to lead others through “first-person future” simulations, which have been shown in scientific studies to improve strategy and increase motivation and hope for the future. Along the way, leading futurists from the Institute from the Future will share some of their most challenging forecasts to help you stretch your imagination and improve your simulation skills. 

This course will ensure that you can put all of your new forecasting skills to the best possible use, by helping you nudge your brain toward more effective ways of simulating and preparing for the future.

In medicine and healthcare, evidence-based medicine has revolutionized the way that information is evaluated transparently and objectively. Over the past ten years, a movement in North America and Europe has attempted to translate this revolution to the field of toxicology.
The Center for Alternatives to Animal Testing (CAAT) within the department of Environmental Health and Engineering at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health hosts the first chair for EBT and the secretariat for the EBT Collaboration on both sides of the Atlantic. Based on the Cochrane Collaboration in Evidence-based Medicine, the EBT Collaboration was established at the CAAT to foster the development of a process for quality assurance of new toxicity tests for the assessment of safety in humans and the environment.
Regulatory safety sciences have undergone remarkably little change in the past fifty years. At the same time, our knowledge in the life sciences is doubling about every seven years. Systematic review and related evidence-based approaches are beginning to be adapted by regulatory agencies like the Environment Protection Agency (EPA), the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), and the US National Toxicology Program. They provide transparent, objective, and consistent tools to identify, select, appraise, and extract evidence across studies.

2242,yvmEGWJEEeulCAru6LXRlQ,Value and Business Decision Making,value-business-decision-making,"This course is part of a Specialization titled “Strategy and Finance for a Lifecycle of a Social Business”. It is an introduction to time value of money and will help the learner understand the basics of finance with the ultimate goal of valuing a company from a societal lens. 

The beauty of the modern decision-making framework is that it can be used to understand value creation at any level – the individual, the corporate or nonprofit entity level and from the point of view of society. The applications however become increasingly complex as your lens expands from the individual to the corporate/nonprofit to the global society. In this Specialization we will therefore focus on understanding the frameworks and tools that an individual and an entity (a startup or an established corporation, private or public) can use to understand value enhancing decision-making.

There are two building blocks of decision making – time value of money and risk. 
In this second course, we will use the same framework developed in the first course to evaluate decision-making by entities – businesses – to create value. We will realize how the evaluating value from the lens of multiple stakeholders is inherently more complex. You are also encouraged to think from a societal standpoint because that, ultimately, is the difference between a social and a private business. The societal perspective is the most complex and market prices are typically not available for both the benefits and costs. 

As indicated at the outset, the beauty of modern frameworks and tools of analysis is that they are logical and do not change depending on the purpose of business. However, to demonstrate social impact is very complex because prices for both the public good, and any harm created by our actions, are not available. It is also very challenging to determine the incremental effect of a business on society at large.  The combination of these issues makes all social impact and value specific to a business, making it even more important to use the same frameworks and tools developed in this Specialization to value any business."

Thermodynamics can assess the viability of a process and is one of the curriculum's most essential topics. The principles are utilized in following engineering courses (kinetics, mass transfer, design, materials) and are applicable to numerous engineering disciplines. The increased emphasis on energy usage and transformation as a result of rising demand, diminishing supply, and global warming necessitates that the engineers who will tackle these issues have a firm grasp of thermodynamics.

The first and second laws will be studied in this course. Non-ideal features of single-component and multicomponent systems will be emphasized. A substantial portion of the course is devoted to solution thermodynamics, which is crucial for separations (e.g., distillation, extraction, membranes), and chemical equilibrium, which is crucial for reaction engineering.

""A theory is more striking when its premises are simpler, when it relates more diverse types of things, and when its scope of applicability is broader. Consequently, the profound impact that classical thermodynamics had on me. It is the only physical theory with universal content that I am confident, within the range of its applicability, will never be overthrown.""

Grandes entreprises, PME, start-ups mais aussi associations et collectivités publiques, l’économie circulaire fait partie des solutions à déployer à grande échelle par tous ces acteurs pour promouvoir une économie respectueuse des limites planétaires, moins consommatrice en ressources, moins émettrice de gaz à effets de serre et moins productrice de déchets.

A travers ce MOOC, vous comprendrez les limites de l’économie linéaire, fondée sur le principe du “Take-Make-Waste” ou “Extraire-Produire-Jeter” et ainsi que la nécessité d’un changement de modèle vers l’économie circulaire.

L’Économie Circulaire a longtemps été cantonnée au seul secteur du recyclage et de la gestion des déchets. Il faut désormais prendre conscience de son caractère systémique, dans tous les secteurs et du rôle de chaque organisation dans son déploiement.

Pour éclairer vos réflexions, nous sommes allés à la rencontre de 3 entreprises très engagées sur le sujet, issues de secteurs d’activité divers. Elles partageront avec vous leur cheminement pour transformer leur modèle d’affaires en un modèle circulaire. Nous irons également à la rencontre de start-ups, PME et acteurs de l’économie sociale et solidaire, pour mieux comprendre le rôle et la nécessaire coopération entre tous ces acteurs pour passer d’une économie linéaire à une économie circulaire.

Nous avons réalisé ce MOOC avec l’agence de conseil en stratégie Circulab, qui aide des organisations du monde entier à créer des solutions circulaires et régénératrices, et vous transmettra les contenus pédagogiques nécessaires, afin de bien comprendre ce qu’est l’économie circulaire, comment elle s’incarne aujourd’hui dans les organisations, et quels sont les défis à relever pour la déployer à plus large échelle."

Las criptomonedas y el metaverso, que hasta entonces eran los focos de atención de periodistas, consultoras y curiosos, prácticamente han pasado al olvido.  A principios de 2024, solo se habla de Inteligencia Artificial es TODOS los ámbitos.  Para explicar este fenómeno, Yuval Noah Harari, autor de best-sellers internacionales como Homo Deus y Sapiens, dijo que la Inteligencia Artificial ha hackeado el sistema operativo de la humanidad, que es precisamente el lenguaje.  También dijo que, si no logramos establecer mecanismos de control correctos, podría precipitar el final de la historia humana. 
Sea como fuere, y sin caer en especulaciones acerca de su impacto, la Inteligencia Artificial se compone de distintas herramientas que, gracias a ChatGPT, han pasado de la oscuridad de laboratorios de científicos de datos al alcance de cualquier persona que tenga una PC hogareña o un smartphone.   De eso se trata este MOOC: introducir a curiosos al maravilloso mundo de la Inteligencia Artificial generativa, de la cual ChatGPT es el máximo exponente. 
Vamos a entrar a este mundo de una manera amigable y simple, entender los principales conceptos que le dan forma, y aprender a sacarle jugo a ChatGPT para ayudarnos en tareas diarias, ya sea para fines laborales, estudiantiles o simplemente para curiosear y no perderse conocer lo último de lo último. 
Como ya dijimos, el secreto de la AI generativa ha sido utilizar el lenguaje como base de nuestras interacciones con los modelos (llamados LLMs).  Por esto, el curso se va a enfocar en brindar herramientas y ejemplos concretos para familiarizarnos con los “prompts” que son las órdenes que le damos a los modelos para que operen.  La utilidad que derivemos de la AI y el grado de impacto que pueda tener en nuestras vidas depende en gran parte de cuán bien conozcamos y manejemos estas interacciones.  Está a disposición de todos, lo único que necesitamos es una computadora o un smartphone con acceso a un navegador de internet y conocimientos básicos para operarlos.  Empecemos, ¡no hay tiempo que perder!  
Objetivos del curso: 
• Reconocer el auge de la inteligencia artificial generativa y comprender la importancia de su impacto, real y potencial.
• Conocer las principales técnicas de interacción con ChatGPT, la principal herramienta de Inteligencia Artificial Generativa.
• Analizar diferentes patrones de interacción con la herramienta, teniendo en cuenta que cada uno tiene cierta utilidad que dependerá del objetivo del usuario.

In this guided project, we are going to use TensorFlow's Keras API to create a convolutional neural network which will be trained to classify as well as localize emojis in images. Localization, in this context, means the position of the emojis in the images. This means that the network will have one input and two outputs. Think of this task as a simpler version of Object Detection. In Object Detection, we might have multiple objects in the input images, and an object detection model predicts the classes as well as bounding boxes for all of those objects. In Object Localization, we are working with the assumption that there is just one object in any given image, and our CNN model will classify and localize that object.

Please note that you will need prior programming experience in Python. You will also need familiarity with TensorFlow. This is a practical, hands on guided project for learners who already have theoretical understanding of Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, and optimization algorithms like Gradient Descent but want to understand how to use use TensorFlow to solve computer vision tasks like Object Localization."

2403,XqPMOzDrEeeckAoFzJuh9g,Tinkering Fundamentals: Motion and Mechanisms,tinkering-motion-mechanisms,"The Tinkering Fundamentals course will offer educators and enthusiasts an opportunity to develop a practice of tinkering and making.  We see tinkering as a serious endeavor—one that is generalizable across content and especially good at interweaving disciplines in a way that leads to complex projects and individualized learning opportunities. Tinkering has recently been introduced into the educational field as a potential driver of creativity, excitement, and innovation in science learning. It is seen by many as an effective means to engage in exploring STEM concepts, practices and phenomena. Tinkering typically blends the high and low tech tools of science along with a strong aesthetic dimension that supports children’s (and adults’) self expression.

NB: This is a hands-on course, so you will need several tools and materials to do weekly activities. You are welcome to purchase only what you don't already have—or even better try to scrounge them from surplus stores! We have put together a list of recommended materials, which you can find here: http://bit.ly/motion-materials

For over a decade, the Exploratorium has been developing science-rich tinkering activities for both children and adults. We see tinkering as a fun yet serious endeavor—spanning many disciplines and content areas and fostering connections between art, science, and technology. Learners follow their own path to understanding by investigating tools and materials and exploring questions that interest them. This opens up a wide range of possible answers rather than any specific “right” one, particularly for teaching STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) subjects in the classroom. This course centers on activities related to Motion and Mechanisms, which offer a wealth of opportunities for thinking through making.

In this course, we won’t just show you how we develop tinkering activities; we’ll also delve into why. We’ll focus on three important aspects: activity design around specific materials, facilitation strategies, and environmental organization. We’ll also share some guiding principles and learning indicators we’ve developed that can help you integrate tinkering into your elementary and middle-school science program. Whether you’re new to making or a seasoned tinkerer, we hope this course will help you take the next step!

OUR APPROACH TO TEACHING

This is a hands-on workshop, not a lecture-based class. Participation is essential! We want everyone to be making and tinkering together: trying things out, asking questions, sharing ideas, and reflecting together as a community. This is a wonderful chance to tinker and learn alongside people from all over the world and from all walks of life, so don’t be shy!

PLEASE NOTE: We have put a great deal of effort towards creating a supportive space that encourages exploration. We’ll give you a few ways to get started; prompt you to share your own observations and experience as learners, designers, and facilitators; and hopefully spark interesting conversations and discoveries along the way. While it’s not a requirement, we encourage you to take this class with a friend or colleague, or meet with other people in your area: having support or doing activities with others will enhance your experience and help you stay engaged.

NCA analyzes data using necessity logic. A necessary condition implies that if the condition is not in place, there will be guaranteed failure of the outcome. The opposite however is not true; if the condition is in place, success of the outcome is not guaranteed.  
 
Examples of necessary conditions are a student’s GMAT score for admission to a PhD program; a student will not be admitted to a PhD program when his GMAT score is too low. Intelligence for creativity, as creativity will not exist without intelligence, and management commitment for organizational change, as organizational change will not occur without management commitment.
 
NCA can be used with existing or new data sets and can give novel insights for theory and practice. You can apply NCA as a stand-alone approach, or as part of a multi-method approach  complementing multiple linear regression (MLR), structural equation modelling (SEM) or Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA).
 
This course explains the basic elements of NCA and uses illustrative examples on how to perform NCA with R software. Topics include (i) Setting up an NCA study (ii) Run NCA and (iii) Present the results of NCA.

Achievement of global sustainable development is, therefore, dependent on a profound comprehension of the preunderstandings and implicit imaginaries that form both our perception of reality and our basic confidence in the viability of transgressive action.  

The present-day concept and ideal of sustainable development contains many interlaced meanings and many contradictions. In order to bring out the concept’s indisputable transformative potential, and be able to gain support, promote decision-making and take action in it, it is, therefore, requisite to disentangle this mélange and shed light to the implicit preunderstandings .

This course will contribute to doing so by focusing on the historical roots and multiple layers of meaning of sustainable development, and by exploring questions such as: ‘What is the historical background of the current Sustainable Development Goals?’, ‘Which imaginaries about relations between individual and collective tend to promote and prevent sustainable solutions?’, ‘How can ideas about humans and nature affect global development?’, And ‘how do we as humans react on inconstant notions of time and change?’

During this course, you will meet associate professor in history Bo Fritzbøger from Centre for Sustainable Futures as the primary lecturer and a range of cultural, natural and social scientists, all from the University of Copenhagen working with different aspects of sustainability thinking.

We will revolutionize your way of decision making, by extending static techniques from corporate finance with dynamic methods to quantify strategic thinking. Traditionally, we assess the attractiveness of an investment as a mature business, where future cash flows mainly result from past decisions. But, in an ever-changing world, strategic decisions determine the firm’s long-term success and market value. Yet managers often have to consider these long-term implications using intuition and experience alone, with little guidance from structured, quantitative analysis.

Our treatment goes far beyond the use of standard valuation analysis. We introduce the expanded NPV, which brings together DCF, real options, and game theory. Thinking in terms of options, games, and adaptive strategies may help managers address strategic questions such as: How do you value a leveraged buyout? How can you value a high-tech venture with negative cash flows? When should you invest in new ventures in stages? How can you incorporate rival bidders in the analysis?

The tools we provide can improve your decisions in business and in daily life.

This course will cover pharmacoeconomic, marketing strategy, intellectual property strategy, portfolio management, managed markets and strategic alliances. It will also have a lecture case study from startup to success.

In addition, the course will discuss post-marketing clinical trials or Phase 4 trials. These are conducted after a new drug has been approved by the regulatory agencies and launched. In these studies, the new drug is prescribed in an everyday healthcare environ­ment using a much larger group  of patients.  This enables new treat­ment uses for the new drug to be developed, comparisons with other treatments for the same indication to be made, and determination  of the clinical  effectiveness of the new drug in  a wider variety of  patient types, and  more rare side effects, if any, may be detected .

Pre-marketing strategy should be instigated as early as Phase 1 clinical trials to ensure that the market's needs are incorporated into the new drug's overall develop­ment. Later phases when clinical results are presented at international medical conferences the marketing strategy is then refined in  order to develop an awareness amongst the medical community who will be prescribing the new drug. In addition to the marketing strategy, pricing strategy and a tactical plan will be developed. Promotional material, and the sales force will be trained so that when the product is approved they can promote the drug to physician, pharmacist and nurses.

2529,7GFLpG5wEeWSPQr3Cum54Q,"Doping : Sports, Organizations and Sciences",doping,"The objective of this course is to encourage a critical understanding of doping. To achieve this goal, this course will rely on a multidisciplinary approach that allow you to see how different disciplines get into a single object, in different perspectives and in often complementary ways. This approach will also allow us to appreciate the complexity of a subject like doping.

Doping in sports is a complex practice whose definition and identification is the result of socially and historically constructed norms.
This course offers to shed light on the processes that led to the use and prohibition of doping substances. Performance enhancement or physical transformation are two aspects of doping which are seen as problematic, yet even as we speak companies are making fortunes selling body improvement and other forms of “human enhancement” to us. These apparent contradictions will be analysed to show that beyond sanitary questions, doping raises many social, scientific and legal issues. 
In efforts to control doping, governments and sports authorities have put into place institutions responsible for defining what falls into the category of doping, but also what prevention, repressions and research methods to put into effect. This course will also explore biological control measures such as the biological passport, key legal dimensions, organisations that produce performance, as well as the sociological dimensions of doping.

Besides the Professors of University of Lausanne, the best experts of doping are involved in this course: experts from an Anti-doping Laboratory (LAD- Lausanne-Switzerland), from the CAS (Court of Arbitration for Sport), from the UEFA (soccer), and from the WADA (World Anti-Doping Agency).

This course assumes you have previous programming experience in some other language. Although we'll start at the very beginning for C++, hardly anybody learns (or teaches) C++ as a first language. Similarly, Unreal Engine is a commercial, industrial strength game engine. With great power comes great ... complexity, so it's important that you have the will to work hard to learn how to use C++ in Unreal Engine.

Computer programming is really fun in general, and programming games is even better!

Caution: Introduction (starting to learn C++ and Unreal Engine) is not the same as easy (not hard to do). Learning to program using C++ in Unreal Engine IS hard to do, especially since this course is essentially the first half of a freshman-level college course. Meeting the course challenges while you master the material will be rewarding to you, but doing that will require hard work and maybe even a few expletives along the way.

Sin necesidad de ser un experto en data science o programador, actualmente existen una serie de técnicas estadísticas que pueden ser utilizadas por un marketer, como excel y spss, y estas le permitirán realizar data mining o extracción de datos, para identificar las variables importantes de un producto, clasificar a los consumidores, organizar sus gustos y en general, tomar decisiones precisas con una base matemática a problemas complejos.

2631,Ry_QdsClEeS1xCIACzaDSQ,Tinkering Fundamentals: Circuits,tinkering-circuits,"The Tinkering Fundamentals course will offer educators and enthusiasts an opportunity to develop a practice of tinkering and making.  We see tinkering as a serious endeavor—one that is generalizable across content and especially good at interweaving disciplines in a way that leads to complex projects and individualized learning opportunities. Tinkering has recently been introduced into the educational field as a potential driver of creativity, excitement, and innovation in science learning. It is seen by many as an effective means to engage in exploring STEM concepts, practices and phenomena. Tinkering typically blends the high and low tech tools of science along with a strong aesthetic dimension that supports children’s (and adults) self expression.

For over a decade, the Exploratorium has been developing science-rich tinkering activities for both children and adults. We see tinkering as a fun yet serious endeavor—spanning many disciplines and content areas and fostering connections between art, science, and technology. Learners follow their own path to understanding by investigating tools and materials and exploring questions that interest them. This opens up a wide range of possible answers rather than any “right” one, particularly for teaching STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) subjects in the classroom. This course centers on circuit-related activities, which offer a wealth of opportunities for thinking through making.

In this course, we won’t just show you how we develop tinkering activities; we’ll also delve into why. We’ll focus on three important aspects: activity design around specific materials, facilitation strategies, and environmental organization. We’ll also share some guiding principles and learning indicators we’ve developed that can help you integrate tinkering into your elementary and middle-school science program. Whether you’re new to making or a seasoned tinkerer, we hope this course will help you take the next step!

OUR APPROACH TO TEACHING

This is a hands-on workshop, not a lecture-based class. Participation is essential! We want everyone to be making and tinkering together: trying things out, asking questions, sharing ideas, and reflecting together as a community. This is a wonderful chance to tinker and learn alongside people from all over the world and from all walks of life, so don’t be shy!

PLEASE NOTE: Although this course will not have active instructor participation, we have put a great deal of effort towards creating a supportive space that encourages exploration. We’ll give you a few ways to get started; prompt you to share your own observations and experience as learners, designers and facilitators; and hopefully spark interesting conversations and discoveries along the way. While it’s not a requirement, we encourage you to take this class with a friend or colleague or meet with other people in your area: having support or doing activities with others will enhance your experience and help you stay engaged.

REQUIRED COURSE MATERIALS

You will need several tools and materials to do weekly course activities. Pre-bundled materials are available from the Exploratorium store at www.artoftinkering.com. Please obtain all materials as soon as possible, well in advance of when you will need them in the course. Be sure to allow extra time for shipping and, if you are outside the U.S., for customs. In some cases, certain items may require assembly. Please refer to the Resources section to review this course’s activity guides."
2632,ernfJjNOEeyZlQoNyXy15Q,"Leadership in Multinational, Cross-Cultural Teams",leadership-in-mulitnational-cross-cultural-teams,"Whether you are currently a manager or not,  you should now be ready to learn to play a leadership role in a multinational team. Leadership is more than management, and culture greatly affects what is expected of leaders. For instance, some cultures expect their leaders to give directives; others expect them to facilitate so that everyone on the team has a chance for their voice to be heard. No matter which way they lean, you are likely to hear “that’s just the way it’s done” if you try to shake things up. Leadership requires adapting your style to build comfort from team members with different backgrounds than yours while also helping change the narrative for people who don’t want to adapt to your strengths. You need to help others find the levers to pull that work for them to adjust to a cross-cultural environment. As leaders you also need to be constantly learning to prepare for the inevitable changes of the future? By looking into the future, how will different cultures grow, and how will climate change and technology fundamentally alter the line between physical and virtual space. What will all this mean for multinational team leadership in the future?"
2633,_zCojmQPEe6vIRJJdXRzxQ,Two-Phase Pipe Hydraulics and Pipe Sizing,two-phase-pipe-hydraulics-and-pipe-sizing,"This particular course entitled “Two-Phase Pipe Hydraulics & Pipe Sizing” under the specialization entitled “Design of Industrial Piping Systems”  is mainly aimed at predicting the two-phase total static pressure drop in a given piping system when both gas and liquid flow through it concurrently.  Pressure drops including heat transfer coefficients depend on two-phase flow regimes since two-phase patterns and local internal structure are different for different flow regimes. Therefore, the formation of various two-phase flow regimes in horizontal and vertical pipes is to be known to the designer, and at the same time, the influence of bend on the formation of two-phase flow regimes in upstream and downstream pipes should also be known. The presence of a bend is inevitable in the piping systems of a plant and its presence restricts the formation of certain two-phase flow regimes commonly found in individual horizontal and vertical pipes for the given flow rates of gas and liquid and pipe diameter. Surprisingly, bend allows the formation of slug flow regimes in both horizontal and vertical pipe runs of a piping system. This is a nerve-wracking issue for the designer since the slug flow regime harms the piping system and in some situations, the slug flow regime becomes the main cause of the failure of the piping system. Therefore, the designer should be cautious during the design of two-phase piping systems and avoid the slug flow regime formation at any cost while designing the two-phase piping system. 
Looking into the severity of two-phase flow on the piping system integrity, the present course focuses on the formation of two-phase flow regimes in horizontal and vertical pipes and their identification based on gas and liquid flow rates using two-phase flow pattern maps. Next, the course focuses on the effect of bends on two-phase flow regime formation in both upstream and downstream pipelines as piping systems are made of connecting straight pipe runs using bends. From this discussion, the learner gets a fair idea about the formation of a certain type of two-phase flow regime, when it happens, and why it happens. Next, the two-phase terminologies are covered as these are frequently used in two-phase piping system design. The relationship among them is equally important in the design and hence, covered in the present course. These terminologies and their relations assist the learner in understanding, analyzing, and applying the various two-phase models to design the two-phase piping system.
Certain idealizations are to be made while dealing with the gas and liquid two-phase flow through the pipe.  Single-phase is well-established, not two-phase. To take advantage of suggested single-phase correlations by the investigators, the two-phase models are developed by assuming liquid alone flows through the pipe with the two-phase mixture flow rate. This assumption introduces the error as it does not appeal the reality. Therefore, while developing the models a term called two-phase multiplier is introduced and made as a multiplication factor to the single-phase pressure drop, to predict the two-phase frictional pressure drop within the acceptable range.  The developed models are popularly known as the Homogeneous Equilibrium Model,  Separated Flow Model, and Drift Flux Model, and the present course is focused on these models. Various two-phase multipliers, methods, techniques, and void fraction correlations are covered in detail in this course. Finally, in this course, practical two-phase problems are considered to demonstrate the prediction of total static pressure drop which is a sum of two-phase frictional, accelerational, and gravitational pressure drops using the two-phase well-known models, methods, techniques, two-phase multipliers, and void fraction correlations and how closely they predict so that learner cannot face any hiccup while he/she designing the two-phase piping systems including single path and multi-path piping systems known as piping networks."

The aviation and Internet infrastructures are also considered ""lifeline infrastructure"" as part of the transportation and communications sectors. Both subsectors are overseen by the Department of Homeland Security National Protection and Programs Directorate which manages the DHS National Infrastructure Protection Program. SSA responsibility for the aviation subsector is shared between the Transportation Security Administration and Federal Aviation Administration under the auspices of the Department of Homeland Security and Department of Transportation respectively.  The Department of Homeland Security retains sole responsibility as the Sector-Specific Agency for the Internet subsector.  While TSA and FAA have regulatory over the aviation subsector, DHS has no regulatory authority whatsoever over the Internet. In response to Executive Order 13636 issued by President Obama in February 2013, both sets of SSAs recommended continuing with voluntary cybersecurity measures. TSA and FAA reported they were working to implement the Transportation Roadmap across all transportation subsectors, including aviation. DHS reported that it was working with Internet providers to implement the Cyber Assessment Risk Management Approach. Despite some differences, the Transportation Roadmap and CARMA are very similar to the NIST Cybersecrity Framework and ES-C2M2 examined previously.  That is to say, they are predicated on a continuous improvement process that engages the whole organization in identifying and implementing incremental changes to enhance cybersecurity practices based on prevailing standards. This module will examine both the aviation and Internet lifeline infrastructure subsectors, and elements and application of the Transportation Roadmap and CARMA."

I think this is a world of possibility, creativity, and deep thought that will enrich the way we think and solve problems. I want to make sure that my son is set up for success in this new world and understands how to use generative AI in a way that helps him learn, create, and solve problems. 

Even though generative AI seems obvious to use, it isn't. Really learning to innovate and succeed with generative AI requires a change in mindset about the way we use it and how we solve problems. We have to teach people to think more, not less about what they are doing.

I spent the last year working with my son to empower him with the skills to use generative AI to augment and amplify his critical thinking and creativity. I distilled this teaching into a series of courses that you can use to help teach your kids, either at home or in the classroom, these same skills. This is the first of these courses.

Some of the things that we have done that you will learn to do with your kids:

- Take pictures of anything and have generative AI turn the photos into world records that you can fact check
- Interactively brainstorm how to build anything out of any material using generative AI as your partner
- Invent new games from photos of everyday objects

I teach a course on Prompt Engineering, which is the study of how you converse and solve problems with generative AI that 100,000s of people have enrolled in. I have gotten to hear about how companies all over the world are changing the future of work with generative AI. These courses are specifically designed to help you teach kids to succeed in this new world.

This course is meant for parents and teachers to do with kids. You watch the videos, preview the exercises, and then lead kids through the fun activities. You decide what to show and how to best communicate with your kids. Along the way, not only will your kids learn to innovate with generative AI, but it will reshape how you use it personally."

Git is open source software originally created by Linus Torvalds. Git manages team files for large and small projects. This allows the team to continuously improve its product. It is used by most major technology companies, and is assumed knowledge for many modern programming and IT jobs.  It is a core component of DevOps, continuous delivery pipelines and cloud-native computing. You could also use Git to manage the many continuously improving revisions of that book that you are writing. 

In this course, you will not learn everything there is to know about Git, but you will build a strong conceptual understanding of the technology, and afterward will be able to confidently dig deeper on any topic that interests you. This course assumes no previous knowledge of Git, but if you do have experience with it, you may find this course to be both useful and challenging. This is especially true if you currently ""know just enough Git to be dangerous"". 

There are two paths in this course. Both rely heavily on hands-on labs. One path assumes that you have experience using a command line interface, and the other path uses the Sourcetree graphical client. If you are not experienced with a command line, we highly suggest that you go through the Sourcetree path. Eventually, you might want to go through both paths, so that you can decide which tool to use for specific tasks. Besides, repetition is good for learning :)

You can watch the videos and take the quizzes from your phone if you want, but the hands-on labs require you to have a Windows or Mac computer. If you use the command line path through the course, you can also use Linux. 

This course uses Bitbucket (bitbucket.org) as the hosted provider for remote Git repositories. Bitbucket is free for teams of up to 5 people, including private repositories. However, most of the knowledge that you gain in this course applies to Git itself, and you can apply this knowledge to other hosted Git providers (such as GitHub). 

This course tries to be as concise as possible. It will probably take you about 5-10 hours to go through one of the two paths, but your mileage may vary."

Our course demonstrates how a new scholarship of discovery is redefining what is singular about modern China and modern Chinese history. Current understandings of human history and social theory are based largely on Western experience or on non-Western experience seen through a Western lens. This course offers alternative perspectives derived from Chinese experience over the last three centuries. We present specific case studies of this new scholarship of discovery divided into two stand-alone parts, which means that students can take any part without prior or subsequent attendance of the other part.

Part 1 (this course) focuses on comparative inequality and opportunity and addresses two related questions ‘Who rises to the top?’ and ‘Who gets what?’.

Part 2 (https://www.coursera.org/learn/understanding-china-history-part-2) turns to an arguably even more important question ‘Who are we?’ as seen through the framework of comparative population behavior - mortality, marriage, and reproduction – and their interaction with economic conditions and human values. We do so because mortality and reproduction are fundamental and universal, because they differ historically just as radically between China and the West as patterns of inequality and opportunity, and because these differences demonstrate the mutability of human behavior and values.

Nenhuma empresa consegue sobreviver sem contratos lucrativos. Dentro de uma empresa, as habilidades de negociação podem levar a avanços na carreira.

Este curso fornece uma introdução prática e holística às estratégias e habilidades que podem levar a negociações de sucesso na vida pessoal e nas transações de negócios. O curso cobre os quatro principais estágios da negociação: (1) planejamento, (2) negociação, (3) criação do contrato e (4) execução do contrato. 

Cada estágio analisa as principais questões que você deverá estar preparado para responder em negociações futuras, como:  
•	Quais são os principais elementos em uma análise de negociação, incluindo o preço de reserva fixado, a meta de expansão, alternativas para o negócio em questão e a zona de acordo potencial?
•	Que diretrizes devem ser seguidas ao confrontar questões de ética?
•	Qual é a sua fonte de poder nas negociações e como é possível aumentar o seu poder?
•	Quais ferramentas psicológicas podem ser usadas durante as negociações e quais armadilhas psicológicas devem ser evitadas?
•	Quais são as quatro principais questões de lei contratual que devem estar no checklist de negociação?
•	Quais conceitos e ferramentas podem ser usados ao resolver controvérsias?  

Durante o curso, você assistirá a uma série de pequenos vídeos (que vão de 5 a 20 minutos) sobre cada estágio da negociação.  Os vídeos são interativos e incluem questões para testar o seu entendimento sobre estratégias e habilidades de negociação. O curso também inclui vídeos que dramatizam a arbitragem de uma controvérsia na área de construção e a mediação de uma controvérsia de software de robótica. 

Dependendo do seu planejamento, pode assistir aos vídeos ao longo de algumas semanas ou pode assisti-los todos de uma vez.  Um aluno que assistiu a todos os vídeos de uma vez concluiu que ""É uma série tão boa quanto Breaking Bad"".

Após assistir aos vídeos sobre os quatro principais estágios da negociação, você poderá participar de uma negociação individual que testará as suas qualificações como negociador.  Os vídeos finais do curso verificam a sua negociação e revisam os conceitos e as ferramentas tratados no curso.  Você também receberá feedback sobre o que faz de melhor como negociador e como pode melhorar.

2943,nsSYpgD-EeyHlw6-urbWjw,The Total Data Quality Framework,the-total-data-quality-framework,"By the end of this first course in the Total Data Quality specialization, learners will be able to: 
1. Identify the essential differences between designed and gathered data and summarize the key dimensions of the Total Data Quality (TDQ) Framework; 
2. Define the three measurement dimensions of the Total Data Quality framework, and describe potential threats to data quality along each of these dimensions for both gathered and designed data; 
3. Define the three representation dimensions of the Total Data Quality framework, and describe potential threats to data quality along each of these dimensions for both gathered and designed data; and 
4. Describe why data analysis defines an important dimension of the Total Data Quality framework, and summarize potential threats to the overall quality of an analysis plan for designed and/or gathered data.

This specialization as a whole aims to explore the Total Data Quality framework in depth and provide learners with more information about the detailed evaluation of total data quality that needs to happen prior to data analysis. The goal is for learners to incorporate evaluations of data quality into their process as a critical component for all projects. We sincerely hope to disseminate knowledge about total data quality to all learners, such as data scientists and quantitative analysts, who have not had sufficient training in the initial steps of the data science process that focus on data collection and evaluation of data quality. We feel that extensive knowledge of data science techniques and statistical analysis procedures will not help a quantitative research study if the data collected/gathered are not of sufficiently high quality.

This specialization will focus on the essential first steps in any type of scientific investigation using data: either generating or gathering data, understanding where the data come from, evaluating the quality of the data, and taking steps to maximize the quality of the data prior to performing any kind of statistical analysis or applying data science techniques to answer research questions. Given this focus, there will be little material on the analysis of data, which is covered in myriad existing Coursera specializations. The primary focus of this specialization will be on understanding and maximizing data quality prior to analysis."

This course is an introduction to the life and thought of the reformer John Calvin (1509-1564) and to his influence on the modern and contemporary world. The approach we develop is critical:  we intend neither to canonize nor to condemn Calvin or his thought. Our goal, rather, is to avoid any rash evaluation in order to understand his thought and analyze the issues at stake in it.

During five weeks, we will explore together the life and work of the Reformer. During the first week, we will study the main aspects of Calvin’s life. Weeks 2 and 3 will focus on his theology and his ethics. During the last two weeks (weeks 4 and 5), we will ponder how Calvinism became a worldwide phenomenon and ask ourselves what kind of relevance Calvin’s thought may still have today."

Thinking globally helps explain new linkages between changes in the natural environment (demography, climate) and transformations of institutional designs. 
Will societies and peoples find a way to get along together in the long run despite intractable conflicts and divergence of social and national interests? Will States delegate enough sovereignty to universal organizations, breaking definitely with Hobbes’ constant (no transfer of power beyond national borders)? Will the World ever be governed, and more democratically governed? 
To answer this series of central questions, global politics draws on anthropology, history, sociology, economics and psychology. A mix of paradigms comforts this mix of disciplines, since no single approach may suffice to explain global issues. Combining various ways of thinking is conducive to a fuller account of the myriads of transactions that make the planet evolve towards a more complex equilibrium."

2973,IbtWNphcEeqwnwrQgE7Raw,Manipulating Data with SQL,manipulating-data-with-sql,"In this course you will learn to write the SQL code to manipulate the data in a relational database table. You’ll begin by populating the table with data. Since a database and its tables are designed and built to be repositories of data, getting the data into the tables is a critical activity in the building of a working database. 

When building a new home, the real test of your design comes when the furniture and family move in. It’s much the same with designing and building database tables—the real test comes when you load data into the tables and begin to use it.

As you work through and complete hands-on tasks, you’ll become familiar with SQLiteStudio, the database management system used in the course.  You’ll experience first-hand the impact data types and constraints have on manipulating table data. For example, as you enter new data into a table, you’ll appreciate the extra protection provided by the primary key constraint. It will not let you insert two rows into a table that are exactly alike. 

In addition to adding data to the tables, you’ll write the SQL code used to modify existing data values and to delete rows of data. Managing and manipulating data are SQL’s primary purposes, and SQL coding will be a powerful addition to your tool set.
